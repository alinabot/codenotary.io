> To monitor and manage VMware Virtual Machine Snapshots Opvizor has released a tool called Snapwatcher.  As consultant I see often that admins don’t have an overview of all the snapshots that exists in their environment. The main concerns with Virtual Machine snapshots are:

- Snapshots are created and forgot to remove
- Snapshots can very quickly grow in size
- Snapshots filling datastore space
- Delta files may cause decreased Virtual Machine and host performance
