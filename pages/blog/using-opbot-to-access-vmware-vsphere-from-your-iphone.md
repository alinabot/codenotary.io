I hope you already run OpBot in your environment to simplify your daily job as a VMware consultant or system administrator.

If not, let me give you another idea what you currently miss. Ever tried to access [VMware](http://www.vmware.com) vSphere on your iPhone or Android? Not fun, right. But that changes now with a single import of our OpBot virtual appliance that connects to your [Slack](http://www.slack.com) chat.

And that is just the start of changing your daily routine in a smart way.

When you start using OpBot you can check the existing commands out by typing help.

We made sure, that our output works very well in Slack chat for desktops as well as mobiles when using our embedded commands to check for your virtual machines or ESXi hosts.

The things you need are:

1. a smartphone (you likely have already more than one) or a tablet
2. the slack App ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-business-communication/id618783545?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack&hl=en))
3. our [OpBot appliance and the Slack integration](http://try.opvizor.com/opbot)

ThatÂ´s it. As soon as the Bot account comes live in Slack, you can give OpBot commands either in a direct chat or in a channel. Just remember that you need to address the Bot using @opbot (or the name that you configured) when using a channel.
