# OpBot Simple.Secure.Everywhere -  version 3 goes enterprise

I´m really excited that OpBot is released in version v3, enterprise ready and highly reliable and stable after months of testing. First of all I want to thank all people that gave OpBot a try already in an early stage! There was such an extremely helpful and amazingly positive feedback!

But let's get into details what OpBot v3 delivers out of the box:

### Typical Use Cases

- You’re traveling and you need to check if a particular VM is still alive
- You’re on standby support duty and a system needs a memory reconfiguration and a restart
- Is your backup still running, or is that 5 hour job done and you can start the next task?
- What configuration change happened in the last 2 hours?
- The OS in a VM crashed; any details in the event log?
- Did that VM just restart or was it migrated?
- Are these VM snapshots eating up all my storage left on that datastore?

If you think about it, your day fills up with receptive, simple tasks which each take 15-20 minutes to accomplish.  These tasks require you to be logged in to your environment or to be at your desk.

Oh and did we speak about the device you need to access all that information?

Being honest, what single device is always with you? Laptop, Tablet or Mobile? I bet the answer is Mobile and OpBot is ready to support on any of these devices, no matter how bad the reception is. 

**In the end it's just short text, delivered asynchronous and no fancy GUI that eats most of your bandwidth no matter what you want to do**.

There is a reason why our slogan is simple.secure.everywhere as security is a very important part of our product. Using OpBot you get even more security features then you would typically get using a VPN approach. OpBot itselfs already limits the commands that can be used. 

Furthermore, you can leverage all the **security** functionality **[Slack](http://www.slack.com) chat** provides and use the **permissions** and roles of [VMware](http://www.vmware.com) **vCenter** for maximum security.

Btw. as a paying customer you get access to our growing certified script repository to enhance OpBot with highly valuable features.

Furthermore, our enterprise edition is capable of even more features:

- Restrict Direct Messaging to OpBot
- Full featured built-in on-premise chat, if you're not allowed to use public chat like Slack
- Support for other Chat solutions, like [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/)
- extension for [VMware vRealize Operations](http://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-operations.html) 
- extension for [Splunk](http://www.splunk.com)
- extension for [BMC TrueSight Pulse](http://www.bmc.com/truesightpulse)
- extension for [Rubrik](http://www.rubrik.com)

Last but not least we offer customization packages if you want to limit or blacklist certain commands for certain users or during certain daytime's. Please contact us, if you need further information.

All of these use cases can easily add up and are typically short, quick tasks that happen 20+ times a day. And you spend 5-10 minutes (travelling makes it worse) to get to the point that you can do these tasks. 20+ times opening up a management UI, searching for a system … / Not to mention, remembering the management ip or network name, remembering the credentials… 

If you think about it, your day fills up with receptive, simple tasks which each take 15-20M to accomplish.  These tasks require you to be logged in to your environment or to be at your desk.
