Thanks [Alan](http://twitter.com/alanrenouf) for the great presentation and showing the OpBot [PowerCLI](http://www.vmware.com/go/powercli) integration at [VMworld](http://www.vmworld.com)!

We received a couple of questions since then and here are the answers:

1. Where can I get my license - [just register here and download the appliance and follow the guideline](http://try.opvizor.com/opbot)
2. Is just the 30 day trial free? NO, you really get a free annual license of our basic OpBot edition that is renewing!
3. How to install and setup - please check out our [online manual](https://opvizor.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OPBOT/pages/78544991/QuickStart)
4. Can I run multiple OpBot appliances with the same license? YES, feel free; you find all required information to setup multiple Slack Bots in our online manual
5. Are there any videos I can check out? Yes, here we go - [OpBot Videos](https://vimeo.com/album/4282477)
6. Is OpBot only for Slack? the free edition yes, but we have a commercial offering that support Rocket.Chat (also onpremise)

Check OpBot out and get used to any device, any location, any connection to control your VMware vSphere!
