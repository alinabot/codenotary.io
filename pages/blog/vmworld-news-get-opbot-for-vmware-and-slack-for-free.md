End of last year Opvizor released an incredible helpful ChatOps Bot for VMware vSphere that works as your virtual assistant from anywhere, at any time with any device. OpBot can manage VMware vSphere via natural chat commands and adds itself as a Bot within the highly popular Slack Chat solution.

**Today we have great NEWS!!**

We decided to release the basic edition of OpBot supporting VMware vSphere and Slack completely free of charge! We want to make sure, everybody, no matter what budget concerns there are, is able to use this great way to access VMware vSphere from everywhere using an iPhone, Android phone or whatever.

Only maintenance and support as well enterprise edition (support for VMware vROPs, Opvizor Performance Analyzer and Splunk) still require a commercial license.

OpBot has some important and time saving features that support every day operations:

- No VPN
- No RDP Session
- No Mobile Hotspot
- Any Device
- Any Place
- async commands
- Audit log in the chat
- Avoid annoying bandwidth issues using remote desktops or VMware Web client 

One important information for all existing Performance Analyzer customers is, that OpBot can be simply connected with Performance Analyzer, to request any chart out of the chat session in seconds. That unleashes amazing new remote troubleshooting and analysis possibilities, not just for end customers but also for consultants or vendor professional service or support teams.

**How does an OpBot work?**

You only need to import a virtual appliance in your VMware vSphere environment that consists of a stripped-down Linux and includes the components for a ChatBot and a VMware vSphere API connection broker.

The OpBot, connects to the Slack API and makes itself available as a Slack user waiting for commands via channels or private messages. 

OpBot responds to predefined commands (available with the help command) using the read-only VMware vSphere account you created as a customer and publishes the output of these commands into the chat
