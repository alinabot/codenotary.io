While Wall Street murmurs, grumbles, and balks over whether or not VMware stock is a worthy long-term investment, anyone dealing with enterprise virtualization has their own worries. These are practical worries, such as what might happen to popular products like VMware Workstation and Fusion.

**The Report That Shook VMware**

The mumbling began when the company released it's [fourth quarter earnings report for 2015](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/01/vmware-fusion-workstation-team-culled-in-company-restructure/). Despite strong growth and profits for VMware, including a [10 percent gain in value year over year](http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/earnings/vmw-earnings-release-nongaap-q415.pdf), to a value of $1.87 billion, stocks fell 5.13 percent due to concerns over Dell's potential selling of EMC's interest in VMware to cover the costs of the recent acquisition. Further causing investors pause is the decision to spin off Virtustream, the joint cloud virtualization project between EMC and VMware. To recap, EMC acquired VMware in 2004, and Dell is just wrapping up an acquisition of EMC currently.

During the transition, VMware CFO Jonathan Chadwick has stepped down, and the CFO of EMC, Zane Rowe, is slated to step into that role effective March 1. Following the earnings announcement made by VMware, a team member alerted the world that the teams responsible for developing and maintaining the Workstation and Fusion products had been let go.

**One Piece of a Bigger Puzzle**

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="585"\]![VMware](/images/blog/bigstock-Daily-Scrum-Updating-The-Sprin-101356733.jpg) In the end, shakeups could mean more products and even better products for VMware's users. But that won't be clear for awhile. First, the new management has to settle in and put their fingerprints on the company, its processes, its workers, and its products.\[/caption\]

This layoff is part of a larger restructuring and realignment project to reflect changes in the top management. In all, [about 800 jobs held by VMware employees](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/26/vmware-lay-off-800-cfo-coo-dell-emc/79363842/) got the ax. According to the team member who squealed, these workers should have no trouble finding employment elsewhere, as many up and coming startups and established tech companies in Silicone Valley are eager to sweep them up. Many jobs in the area are already held by former VMware workers.

**The Future of Workstation, Fusion, and Other VMware Development Projects**

VMware's spokesperson maintains that they are still committed to supporting and continuing development for both VMware Workstation and VMware Fusion. The official word is that those development teams will be rebuilt in the same location as the rest of the company. VMware's spokesperson also said that the company is focusing on other "growth products".

What does all this mean for VMware monitoring and other issues? The answers likely won't be clear until the [shakeup of the acquisition](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/vmware-inc/index.html) is said and done. Once Mr. Rowe takes control of VMware as acting CFO, more of his brand of company will begin to emerge. No word yet on any other VMware development teams or projects that might be delayed or cut as these changes play out across the organization.
