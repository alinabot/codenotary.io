These services exist at the core of the CICD pipeline and recently the microservices security market has received a massive validation with the acquisition of Twistlock by Palo Alto Networks.\n\n \n\nAs consumers in the 21st century demand more and more customization for their litany of unique wants and needs, the old school method of software development was bound to give way to a new and better process that enabled reaching that goal. Recently, within the last 5 years or so, the software industry has shifted away from a monolithic culture to one embracing microservices. The microservices industry has been steadily gaining traction and we have witnessed the rise of companies like Docker and Kubernetes that support this new mindset. The new approach has many benefits such as the ability to deploy independently, scale up and maintain each component while simultaneously parallelizing development across numerous teams.\n\n \n\n## **About the Microservices Market**\n\nRapid, lightweight and lean development practices have permeated the industry psyche. In contrast to monolithic software development where massive deployments are followed by countless glitches and errors, microservices are smaller in size and are created for singular use cases. Effectively, they are more sniper targeted applications that are faster to iterate, have less moving parts to incur the wrath of Murphy’s Law, and allow for assembly line like specialization.\n\n \n\nIn economic terms, the benefits of specialization allotted by microservices is leading to greater efficiency. The comparative advantages developing between services is driving both increased returns of scale as well as economies of scale. With history as a predictor, we are likely to continue witnessing the evolution of these benefits.\n\n \n\n## **Microservices and Containers**\n\nContainers are architectural implementations used to develop and manage microservices. They give a user the ability to create, ship, and run any application on any machine by packaging software with everything it needs to run. They are completely isolated from any other software that runs concurrently in the same environment. Furthermore, they let different teams develop different microservices simultaneously. Additionally, containers allow for the ability for both associated and non-associated teams to share in and utilize each others’ productions. Due to their power and flexibility, both containers and microservices have become popular and well regarded tools in DevOps communities.\n\n \n\nThat said, microservices are not without their challenges. One case in point is security. With so many iterations of code and snippets along with increased sharing, the complexities of security can begin to mount. More moving parts means more chances for failure. The more a containerized application is shared, the more chances it has to become tampered, regardless of intent. In traditional monolithic organizations you would run penetration and security tests, but with the speed of delivery, there’s no time for that in DevOps. To complicate matters further, microservices vastly increases the number of ports used in a project leaving significantly more doors to continuously check and prevent bad actors from entering through. Thus it is the burgeoning industry is in need of good security solutions.\n\n \n\n## **Details of the Deal**\n\nIt has been a point of dispute whether or not microservices security is in fact a separate solution and its own industry. However, with the recent $410 million acquisition of container security company, Twistlock, by Palo Alto Networks, the market is validated and happening. To boot, the chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks, Nikesh Arora, was quoted as saying they will be integrating the new assets “as soon as possible.”\n\n \n\nDror Davidoff, co-founder and CEO of Aqua Security, another container security company, noted that the acquisition demonstrates that customers view container/cloud-native security “as critical to their environments”. He furthered by saying, “The acquisition price is very high for a space that is still only about 4 years old, and a major security player demonstrated with their checkbook that the early movers have a significant advantage (or they would have tried to develop it themselves).”\n\n \n\n## **Future Outlook for Global Cloud Microservices**\n\nAccording to market research firm MRFR, the global cloud microservices market is forecasted to be valued at $2.1 billion in 2023, which is a CAGR of 25.0% up from 2017’s market value of $580 million. Some of the major factors driving the market’s growth include:\n\n \n\n- Continued microservices architecture proliferation\n- Increased adoption of cloud services\n- Rising demand for secure IT operations\n- Increased enterprise demand for data security through private cloud applications\n- Drive to reduce costs in on-premise IT deployments\n\n \n\n## **Microservices Asset Integrity and Blockchain Immutability**\n\nAt present, CodeNotary is the only player in the market who is delivering DevOps and microservices asset integrity utilizing blockchain technology. It’s vcn tool adds continuous trust to the DevOps process, containers, and Kubernetes environments and instantly verifies the integrity of code, /images/blog, containers, documents, backups, and more.

Ansible is easy to learn (well, depends on the definition of easy), flexible enough to cover all the corner cases and powerful enough to get the job done.\n\nThen, we need **two** Virtual Machines (VM): one will be our builder, with a hefty internet connection, powerful CPU and fast disks.

It's a little daemon that feeds some entropy in the kernel entropy pool.\n\n**What is an entropy pool?**\n\nWhen your software needs randomness, it spills what is needed from a virtual dice rolling machine, called an entropy pool. Docker, and Compose, use a lot of randomness. \n\nYou can experience unresponsiveness, especially in the startup phase, when the virtual dice are spoiled. Especially on virtual machines, you can find yourself typing “docker-compose up” and be stuck for minutes. That is because the entropy pool is empty and the system is waiting for the random bits to gather themselves in the pool.\n\nSo we add a little service that provides some more randomness, and helps things run smoothly.\n\nIn case you’re interested and want to know more, [this](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ensuring-randomness-with-linuxs-random-number-generator/) is a nice blog article about the kernel random pool.\n\nNext we fetch the Docker GPG key, and add it to the apt system, we add the Docker repository and we fetch the latest docker version. \n\nDocker Compose is directly downloaded into `/usr/local/bin`.\n\n\n## Building the Container images\n\nNow the target is ready and we can focus on the worker and building all the required images.\n\nThe steps are: \n\n\n\n1. clear all the images that are left from previous tasks\n2. pull and build all the required images and export them.\n\nTo clear all images, simply use: \n\n\n```\ndocker images -a -q|xargs -r docker rmi -f\n```\n\n\nThat removes all the images registered to your local Docker system.\n\nNext, we can change into the project directory and launch a “build”:\n\n\n```\n  - name: prune phase\n\tshell:\n  \t  cmd: docker images -a -q|xargs -r docker rmi -f\n  - name: pull phase\n\tshell:\n  \t  chdir: projectdir\n  \t  cmd: docker-compose pull\n  - name: build phase\n\tshell:\n  \t  chdir: projectdir\n    \t  cmd: docker-compose build --parallel\n```\n\n\nUse `--parallel` if you want to test your processor fan.\n\nNow that the images have been built, we can export them. \n\n**Btw. here comes another trick: some images will have a slash (“/”) in the name. So we can not use the image name as a file name. **\n\nEncode the name in base64 and you’re good. It’s less readable, but who cares in that case?\n\n\n```\n  - name: save phase\n\tshell:\n  \t   cmd: docker save {{item}} | gzip > {{item|b64encode}}.tgz\n\tloop: \"{{image_list}}\"\n```\n\n\nMake sure to define the image_list variable with the image names.\n\n\n## Importing the Container images\n\nOnce the images are copied to the target machine, the loop is pretty similar to the export:\n\n\n```\n  - name: docker import\n\tshell:\n  \t   cmd: docker load < {{item|b64encode}}.tgz\n\tloop: \"{{image_list}}\"\n```\n\n\nThat will load all the images into the local Docker registry and we’re ready to go! \n\n**We want our Docker Compose stack to start with the system, therefore we still need a service to make all run automatically.**\n\nSystemd is our friend\n\n\n```\n- hosts: target\n  tasks:\n  - name: Service file creation\n\tcopy:\n  \t  dest: /etc/systemd/system/docker-compose.service\n  \t  content: |\n    \t[Unit]\n    \tDescription=Docker Compose Service\n    \tRequires=docker.service\n    \tAfter=docker.service\n    \t[Service]\n    \tType=oneshot\n    \tRemainAfterExit=true\n    \tWorkingDirectory=/projectdirectory\n    \tExecStart=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans\n    \tExecStop=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose down\n    \t[Install]\n    \tWantedBy=multi-user.target\n  - name: Systemd service activation\n\tsystemd:\n  \tname: docker-compose.service\n  \tenabled: yes\n  \tstate: started\n```\n\n\nThis playbook will install a systemd service that will start and stop our stack. \n\nJob done.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/automatic-deployment-of-a-docker-compose-stack-using-ansible","extension":".md","slug":"automatic-deployment-of-a-docker-compose-stack-using-ansible","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721623882},"$loki":5},{"title":"Avoid the Digital and Code Signing Certificates' Journey of Pain","date":"2019-02-27","image":"/images/blog/bigstock-Portrait-of-an-upset-businessm-138045524.jpg","toc":[{"id":"why-do-we-need-to-sign-our-code-with-a-digital-certificate","depth":3,"text":"Why do we need to sign our code with a digital certificate?"},{"id":"our-hands-on-experience-with-digital-and-code-signing-certificates","depth":3,"text":"Our hands-on experience with digital and code signing certificates"},{"id":"so-far-so-good-but","depth":3,"text":"So far, so good, but..."},{"id":"is-the-singing-certificate-pain-over","depth":3,"text":"Is the singing certificate pain over?"},{"id":"what-is-the-good-news","depth":3,"text":"What is the good news?"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Moshe and Dennis co-founded "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.vchain.us/company/?utm_source=codenotary&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=avoid.the.digital.certificates.journey.of.pain","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"vChain"}]},{"type":"text","value":", the company that created "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://codenotary.io/","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"CodeNotary </>"}]},{"type":"text","value":", out of their frustration with digital and code signing certificates.  As most people reading this blog post will surely agree, digital certificates are a constant source of pain and hassle."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"why-do-we-need-to-sign-our-code-with-a-digital-certificate"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#why-do-we-need-to-sign-our-code-with-a-digital-certificate","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Why do we need to sign our code with a digital certificate?"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Stress","src":"/images/blog/bigstock-Portrait-of-an-upset-businessm-138045524.jpg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The process of getting a digital certificate for "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"code signing"}]},{"type":"text","value":" is better described as:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"extremely cumbersome and time-intensive.

However, with this gain in efficiency and productivity we have lost oversight as well as a deep understanding of what exactly is running in our production environments. As clean code producing, security minded devs and managers alike, we have to know what’s in the box before running a Docker container image.\n\n \n\nAlso, if you’re a team lead, you have to consider if the development libraries that have been approved are really the ones being used in the applications your team is deploying into production.\n\n \n\n## **Know What’s In the Box**\n\nWe, at CodeNotary, have developed a solution that allows devs and teams to rest assured in the integrity of their build code. Additionally, organizations can enforce discipline and good, solid practices in their entire DevOps process.\n\n \n\nFor example, let’s assume that you have a set of Maven libraries or GitHub repositories. After they have been checked for conflicts and vulnerabilities, that have been approved for use in development. Once approved, it’s simple step to sign your binaries using the single command `vcn sign <asset>` with CodeNotary’s vcn CLI tool.\n\n \n\nNow, by signing these binaries you have given them a unique identity with a unique hash that is indelibly stored on our distributed ledger technology. Then, at any time during the build or deployment process, you can make sure that you and/or your team are working with only the approved libraries and not using the non-approved ones.\n\n \n\n## **Verify Before Running an Image or at Download**\n\nVerifying assets is pretty simple as well. There are actually 3 ways to check the integrity of approved assets, which you can do when you first download them locally or later just prior to executing them. You can use the:\n\n \n\n 1)  **[CodeNotary vcn CLI tool](https://www.codenotary.io/how-it-works/)** using the command `vcn verify <asset>` for verification anytime.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary vcn CLI tool - Trusted](/images/blog/vcn-CLI-tool-Trusted-300x80.png)\n\n \n\n     2)  **[CodeNotary - Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vchain-codenotary-downloa/mnloemedehacppeggbipipjlphdjpjcb)** for verification at download.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary Chrome Ext - Integrity Verified - Chrome](/images/blog/CodeNotary-Chrome-Ext-Intergity-Verified-Chrome-300x49.png)\n\n \n\n     3)  **[CodeNotary drag and drop verification page](https://verify.codenotary.io/)** which is available whenever you need it and has the added benefit of displaying the MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes for each asset.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary - Drag & Drop - Verification - Verified](/images/blog/CodeNotary-Drag-Drop-Verification-Verified-186x300.png)\n\n \n\n \n\nWith multiple different ways to verify your cleared-to-use assets, you can easily authenticate the evergreen tree of matrix binaries and environments that often stretch across geographically dispersed locations.\n\n \n\nWith CodeNotary, you can ensure confidence in your DevOps integrity workflow and always know what’s in the box before running a Docker container image. But you don’t have to take our word for it. Check it out for yourself and see.

It has the most contributors in both public and private repositories as well as from organizations of all sizes from all over the world. JavaScript is the programming language behind much of the web and is used to build interactive plugins and websites. Almost every web app which runs in your browser is based on some kind of JavaScript framework. In this blog, you’ll find out how to bulletproof your JavaScript app integrity for free with blockchain.\n\n \n\nWith JS being so ubiquitous, it’s also a common attack vector. As well put in [this](https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5) article on Hacker Noon: \n\n \n\n_There’s no shortage of smart, nasty people out there. \\[With\\]_ [580,000 npm packages](http://www.modulecounts.com/) _out there, \\[it\\] seems to me that the odds are better than even...at least one of those packages has some malicious code in it, and that if it’s done well, you would never even know._\n\n \n\nHere we realized we had a unique opportunity to make our own little contribution to the community. Thus we decided to make our JS integration publicly available for free by open sourcing the core of our verification-related applications  ([verify.codenotary.io](https://verify.codenotary.io/) and [CodeNotary - Downloads Verification Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vchain-codenotary-downloa/mnloemedehacppeggbipipjlphdjpjcb)) as a JS package. Now, every one of the millions of JS developers out there can verify the files within their web applications and check them against the immutability of the blockchain.\n\n## **So Why Did We Release the Package on NPM as Well?**\n\nAs you might have picked up, we enjoy helping to make the world a better place. Since we’re releasing our JS integration because it’s the most widely used coding language, it goes pretty much hand in hand that we would also release a verification version on the world’s largest software registry that hosts mainly JS software packages. And that is what we’re doing. \n\n \n\nDevelopers can add our `jsvcn` package into their modern JavaScript frontend application with one single npm command: \n\n \n\nnpm install jsvcn\n\n \n\n## **Why Should You as a Developer Use This Package?**\n\nFirst off, you don’t have to do anything. But if you want a free, easy to use method for verifying the code you use and produce is safe and untampered, then you might want to check out the JS client from [CodeNotary](http://codenotary.io/). It’s a well designed and unit tested package that provides a simple interface and configuration options so you don’t have to deal with all the complexities of blockchain communication. All you do is just choose the file that needs to be checked and it returns its blockchain stored verification status as well as it’s accompanying details and metadata. \n\n## **CodeNotary’s JSVCN Features**\n\nIn short, what `jsvcn` provides is the verify-subset of our `vcn` tool’s functionality i.e. it verifies digital assets via the CodeNotary Blockchain and queries asset metadata from CodeNotary.\n\n \n\nIn order to do the same and verify your files, simply use the single call: \n\n \n\nimport Jsvcn from \"jsvcn\"\n\nconst FILE \\= new File(...);\n\nconst jsvcn \\= new Jsvcn();\n\njsvcn.verify(FILE).then(({ status }) \\=> {\n\n ...\n\n})\n\n \n\nAlternatively, you can also verify a file directly by using the file’s SHA256 hash in the command:  \n\njsvcn.verify(\"<SHA256 hash>\");\n\n \n\n## **How It Works** \n\nUnder the hood, `jsvcn.``verify()` reads the provided file and generates a unique SHA256 hash from it, which then gets sent to the CodeNotary blockchain to be immutably stored forever. After it processes, you get back the file’s trust status with the help of the Ethereum Web3 library ([https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/)). \n\n \n\nIn the case the asset was already signed, a second server request queries CodeNotary’s asset server and extends the blockchain response. So in the verify method’s response, you get the status of the asset and all the CodeNotary stored metadata regarding the digital asset.\n\n \n\nThe package is a pure ES6 library which means developers can integrate it into any web app built with modern JS frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.). The only requirement is that the app should have some kind of build pipeline such as Webpack, Rollup, or others.\n\n \n\n## **Important** \n\nThe verify method DOES NOT UPLOAD the file you verify. It sends only the hash of the file to our servers. Reading and hashing the file happens 100% on the client side, in the browser environment, and in memory. To keep the browser’s memory usage low the package does this in an efficient and optimized way i.e. it reads and calculates the hash in small chunks. \n\n \n\nThis means developers can develop frontend clients who are able to verify large files on the client side without any performance degradation. And thanks to our hashing-based solution, the digital asset never leaves the user’s computer. \n\n \n\n## **Extra features** \n\n### **Hashing Progress Complete Indicator**\n\nVerifying (hashing) huge files, such as ones that are several GBs or more, takes time. The CodeNotary Verify method provides a progress callback as a second parameter which periodically returns the percentage value of the hashing progress. To do so use the command:\n\n \n\njsvcn.verify(FILE, (progress) \\=> console.log(progress + '%'));\n\n \n\nThis way you can have the application display the hashing progress to your users.\n\n \n\n### **Additional Checksum Calculations**\n\n[CodeNotary.io](http://codenotary.io/) uses SHA256 algorithm to generate and compare hashes, but the package can also provide the SHA1 and MD5 checksums alongside with the SHA256 hash calculation. In this case, the Verify constructor needs some additional configuration with the name of the desired checksums as shown below:\n\n \n\nconst jsvcn \\= new Jsvcn({checksums: \\[\"sha1\", \"md5\"\\]});\n\n \n\n### **Current Real World Use of the CodeNotary Library**\n\nYou should know that this is an actively maintained library that is making over 140,000 verifications per day. Two apps currently using the library are:\n\n \n\n- [CodeNotary Drag and Drop Verification Webpage](https://verify.codenotary.io/)\n- [CodeNotary Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vchain-codenotary-downloa/mnloemedehacppeggbipipjlphdjpjcb)\n\n \n\nAdditionally, the CodeNotary roadmap includes plans to extend the library even further in the future. \n\n \n\n### **Demo**\n\nTo see what the raw response of the library’s verify method looks like that you can pull into your application, check out this very simple demo of CodeNotary Verify in Vue.js <[**here**](https://vchain-us.github.io/jsvcn/)\\>. If you want, you can get the source code of the demo application <[**here**](https://github.com/vchain-us/jsvcn/tree/master/example)\\> on GitHub page. \n\n \n\n### **What CodeNotary Is** \n\nCodeNotary offers decentralized verification of digital assets and lets users know who signed them as well as that they are 100% untampered regardless of what the asset is, where it is hosted or the languages, frameworks, or platforms it uses. In addition, CodeNotary’s continuous verification and enforcement features identify unknown and untrusted software components instantly and prevent them from being allowed to run without any additional work required from you.

(See the [recent decision by Notepad++ to give up on digital certificates in favour of GPG.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/notepad-adds-gpg-signature-to-verify-authenticity/))\n\n \n\nThe main advantages of GPG are its accessibility (you don’t need a CA to verify who you are in order to get a signing key) and the fact that it’s free.\n\n## **The Holes in GPG**\n\nIs GPG the solution to secure the software industry? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Here's why:\n\n \n\n- **It's too technical** - Setting up GPG, whether on Mac, Linux or Windows, requires in-depth technical knowledge.\n- **It's too cumbersome** - In order to verify someone’s code, you need to:\n    1. Import his/her key to your key ring and sign it.\n    2. Do numerous checks to confirm the key corresponds to the person who declared said key. (And by the way, you can’t rely on the Keyserver for that.)\n    3. Import the code signature (if it’s been created and detached from the code).\n    4. Check if the binary was actually signed by the person who is claiming to be the signer.\n- **Its granularity is too coarse** - Similar to digital certificates, GPG is also used only to sign releases for main products or repositories, though they are not for any and all types of software assets. Their sphere of authenticity is limiting.\n- **It doesn't fit in with current engineering best practices (CICD and DevOps)** - GPG is generally used for signing developers’ code. Gits support GPG signatures for that reason. However, at the same time, because GPG verification requires multiple steps, you cannot streamline the verification process within a single, easy to use build script.\n- **The Web of Trust is impractical** \\- It’s a nice concept but it doesn’t work. (Check out this scathing post [**here**](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/12/op-ed-im-giving-up-on-pgp/) by Filippo Valtora on the subject.)\n- **Identities are not certified** \\- Even well known Richard Stallman says in his personal blog **[here](https://stallman.org/)** to not to trust the keys under his name on any keyserver.\n\n## **GPG at the End of the Day**\n\nAs I mentioned before, you need to triangulate information, which takes time and it’s still not 100% secure.\n\n \n\nIn the end, GPG does not really improve questionable situations any better than digital certificates do. The only advantage of GPG compared to digital certificates is that it’s free, but that’s only when you’re calculating the direct costs. If you count in the indirect costs of installing malicious code signed with GPG thinking it was secure, then the price goes up significantly.\n\n \n\nHonestly, what are we to expect given that GPG, as well as digital certificates, were not made to sign code? Digital certificates were actually developed by Netscape to verify a domain and encrypt the information exchanged between clients and websites. Similarly, GPG was born to encrypt and sign email communication. Unfortunately for the rest of us, the industry just decided to put a square peg technology into a problematic round hole.\n\n## **Solving the GPG Problem**\n\nTo secure the software industry, a solution is needed that is designed specifically to address this problem. This is why vChain decided to develop CodeNotary, a one-step solution that guarantees your code is exactly how you left it.\n\n \n\nCodeNotary's blockchain-based application gives you the ability to maintain a high-level view of all your code from the main release level on down to the fine, granular level of components, scripts, and beyond. Not only is CodeNotary a proactive DevSecOps best practice, but the savings that mount from preventing scaled problems happening further down the production pipeline is one of those rare moments to breathe easy.\n\n \n\nSound too good to be true?

This is further proven by a TechTarget [report](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/252460108/Study-reveals-sale-of-SSL-TLS-certificates-on-dark-web) that anyone can buy a counterfeit EV certificate for the same amount or less that passes the CA’s own authenticity test. And they can do so without spending the same amount of time to get it issued.\n\n \n\n## **A Better, Technologically Upgraded Way to Sign Code**\n\n \n\nLuckily, there is a better way with **CodeNotary** </>. It proves the authenticity of software assets in one single step of signing.\n\n \n\nCheck how much money you can save on digital certificates using [CodeNotary </>](http://www.codenotary.io/pricing/) and join the community that will change code signing forever. The certificate authority industry is yet one more industry that is being disrupted by blockchain and smart contract technology.\n\n \n\nStart your free trial of CodeNotary now and leave the pain behind.\n\n \n\n[Sign Me Up!](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n\n \n\nIf you have missed our first two blogs on the topic, you can find them [here](https://www.codenotary.io/avoid-the-digital-and-code-signing-certificates-journey-of-pain/) and [here](https://www.codenotary.io/the-code-signing-certificates-journey-of-pain-the-saga-continues/).\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/code-signing-certificates-journey-of-pain-3-when-even-signing-isnt-enough","extension":".md","slug":"code-signing-certificates-journey-of-pain-3-when-even-signing-isnt-enough","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721623980},"$loki":11},{"title":"Can a Chrome Extension Protect Me from Malware Better Than Google and Digital Certificates Do?","image":"/images/blog/Blog-vChain-Putty-verify-ok.png","date":"2019-04-18","toc":[{"id":"is-my-download-bonafide-and-untampered-software","depth":2,"text":"Is my download bonafide and untampered software?"},{"id":"testing-the-integrity-of-putty-downloads","depth":3,"text":"Testing the integrity of PuTTY Downloads"},{"id":"what-are-the-main-takeaways","depth":2,"text":"What are the main takeaways?"},{"id":"how-codenotary-chrome-extension-protects-you-from-malware","depth":2,"text":"How CodeNotary Chrome extension protects you from malware?"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Today, when you look for a well-known application on Google, you are more than likely to find dozens of download links from different websites.

The update includes organizational management and signing features, CodeNotary for Kubernetes suite add-on - Kube-Notary: a K8s watchdog, and the JVCN for Maven plugin and JSVCN for JavaScript package. \n\n \n\n## **What’s New in CodeNotary** \n\n- **Organization management:** \n    - Ability to create an organization and add users to it from the dashboard\n    - Ability to sign assets in the organization’s name\n    - Ability to verify an asset based on an organization \n- **CodeNotary for Kubernetes:**\n    - Kube-notary: a Kubernetes watchdog to continuously monitor Kubernetes cluster at runtime and notify when unknown or untrusted container /images/blog \n        - CodeNotary created Grafana dashboard\n        - Verification metrics exporter for Prometheus \n- **JVCN:** the Maven plugin allows for the verification of dependency integrity during builds \n- **JSVCN:** the JavaScript package allows for the verification of a digital asset's integrity that is used in a web application\n\n \n\n[Start Using CodeNotary](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n\n \n\n## **Organizational Management**\n\nEnterprise users now can sign the digital assets their organization produces by creating an organization in the dashboard (below) for their company. New organizational team members can be directly in the dashboard as seen below as well.\n\n![CodeNotary Organizational Dashboard View](/images/blog/My-Org-Dashboard-View-300x195.png)\n\n \n\n#### **Verifying a Digital Asset Against an Organization**\n\nVerification of an organization’s digital asset can be done from anywhere globally, both from inside and outside of the organization. This allows for users outside of the signing organization to be sure that the indicated organization did, in fact, sign the digital asset they are seeking to use.\n\n \n\n#### **Verifying Against a Group of Signers (Keys)**\n\nGroups of signers or organizations such as several vendors like [microsoft.com](http://microsoft.com), [redhat.com](http://redhat.com), and [opvizor.com](http://opvizor.com) can be required to have all their signatures approved before a digital asset is okayed to be used. For example, before an asset is allowed to be used internally or passed off to another contractor, signatures from multiple responsible parties, e.g. contractors, auditors, regulators, etc., all need to sign off on an asset first.\n\n \n\nMore information can be found on our blog [here](https://www.codenotary.io/guarantee-trust-of-your-companys-deployed-devops-assets-with-blockchain/).\n\n \n\n## **CodeNotary for Kubernetes: Kube-Notary**\n\n`kube-notary` is the first add-on of the CodeNotary for Kubernetes suite. It acts as a watchdog for users’ Kubernetes environments and continuously monitors clusters at runtime, issuing instant notifications when an unknown, untrusted, or unsupported container image is found running. After deploying the service within a cluster, all pods are continuously checked by matching the hash signature of the running image to the hash that is stored immutably on the blockchain. If the hashes match, trust is verified. Containers are checked and re-verified at regular, user-specified intervals. If any containers are found that are not ‘Trusted’, `kube-notary` alerts you instantly.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, `kube-notary` comes with a built-in verification [metrics](https://github.com/Sanderson462/kube-notary#Metrics) exporter, everything can be easily visualized in a Prometheus time series database using the CodeNotary created Grafana dashboard (screenshot below). \n\n \n\n![Kubernetes vcn Grafana Dashboard Visual 2](/images/blog/Kubernetes-vcn-Grafana-Dashboard-Visual-2-300x132.png)\n\n \n\nMore information can be found about `kube-notary` on our GitHub page [here](https://github.com/vchain-us/kube-notary) or the Grafana dashboard [here](https://github.com/vchain-us/kube-notary/tree/master/grafana).\n\n \n\n## **JVCN** \n\n![CodeNotary & Maven Integration Graphic](/images/blog/CodeNotary-Maven-Integration-Graphic-300x232.png) \n\nThe `jvcn-maven` plugin allows for the verification of dependency integrity during builds. Additionally, the build process can be stopped by the plugin if it encounters a non-trusted dependency.\n\n \n\nMore information can be found on our blog [here](https://www.codenotary.io/staying-safe-when-pulling-from-maven-central-and-other-repos/ ) or GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/vchain-us/jvcn-maven-plugin).\n\n \n\n## **JSVCN**\n\nThe JVSCN package is an easy to use JavaScript client for the CodeNotary platform. It allows for the verification of digital assets used in web applications by connecting directly to the CodeNotary blockchain and querying asset metadata from CodeNotary. This way developers can integrate the power of the blockchain with their web apps without having to deal with the complexity of communicating with a blockchain. The package is unit tested and well designed and is a verify-subset of our `vcn` tool functionality. It is available on NPM [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsvcn).\n\n \n\nMore information can be found on our blog [here](https://www.codenotary.io/bulletproof-your-javascript-app-integrity-for-free-with-blockchain-integration-available-on-npm/) or GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/vchain-us/jsvcn).\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/codenotary-product-update-july-2019","extension":".md","slug":"codenotary-product-update-july-2019","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624020},"$loki":14},{"title":"Free Docker Container Integrity Verification Sought and Found","image":"/images/blog/check-mark-green-300x164.jpg","date":"2019-06-11","toc":[{"id":"the-search-for-finding-docker-container-integrity-verification","depth":2,"text":"The Search for Finding Docker Container Integrity Verification"},{"id":"words-from-a-happy-downloader","depth":2,"text":"Words from a Happy Downloader"},{"id":"traditional-download-notification-nonsense","depth":2,"text":"Traditional Download Notification Nonsense"},{"id":"simple-code-to-ensure-container-integrity-that-goes-beyond-tradition","depth":2,"text":"Simple Code to Ensure Container Integrity That Goes Beyond Tradition"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":2,"text":"Conclusion"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"check mark (green)","src":"/images/blog/check-mark-green-300x164.jpg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One dev in his search to find a way to continuously verify his Docker container integrity recently notified us about his search and the answer he found.

In fact,  vetted files would be one of the first places they would target as certified binaries often causes security to lower their defenses.\n\n \n\n## **Words from a Happy Downloader**\n\nRufus mentioned he had found a solution by Googling and found a product called CodeNotary. His email is below:\n\n \n\n_Just found this interesting little tool called CodeNotary today. Set it up and within about 8 minutes I could sign and verify my containers. It also had the continuous verification that I was looking for. The setup process was really straightforward._ _Of course, as I downloaded vcn from the internet (GitHub) on my Windows machine I got the usual annoying warnings during the install process as I forgot to unblock the file. I’ve seen those things pop a lot for legit software though and really don’t put too much stock into digital certificates these days._\n\n \n\n_What was pretty cool was that once I had set up the Chrome extension and installed the tool on another machine to test it, I got a clean notification from CodeNotary assuring me that the file integrity of the CLI installer was trusted._\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary Chrome Extension - Integrity Verified - Brave](/images/blog/CodeNotary-Chrome-Ext-Intergity-Verified-Brave-300x48.png)\n\n \n\n_Verified right at download.

Y’all should check it out if you haven’t already.)_\n\n \n\n## **Traditional Download Notification Nonsense**\n\nThe download notification Rufus was referring to that pops up during download only pops up because we weren’t ok with paying $1000 more for a different digital certificate that does the exact same thing as the basic version does but with one small difference. That difference is the removal of the warning that pops up at download. For a $1000? That's alright. We'll pass. It will eventually disappear once we reach a certain amount of downloads. In the meantime, it’s easy for users to unblock the downloaded file after the download has completed and bypass the nonsense.\n\n \n\n## Simple Code to Ensure Container Integrity That Goes Beyond Tradition\n\nIt's actually really easy to ensure the integrity of your containers (or other code, /images/blog, files, backups, etc.). With the command line interface, it's one step to sign (`vcn sign`) and one step to verify (`vcn verify`). \n\nAnd there's actually one other way to quickly verify in addition to the Chrome app and the CLI command, which is by using CodeNotary's drag and drop webpage. You can check out its functionality [here](https://verify.codenotary.io/intro)  as well as see it in the screenshots below:\n\n \n\n \n\n![](/images/blog/CodeNotary-Drag-and-Drop-Verify-Intro-Page-300x242.png)\n\n \n\nAfter the verification check runs and shows you whether the asset is verified or not, it will also show you the MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes for the file in case you ever want to double check and do a manual verification test yourself.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary - Drag & Drop - Verification - Verified](/images/blog/CodeNotary-Drag-Drop-Verification-Verified-186x300.png)\n\nAlso, you can get the Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vchain-codenotary-downloa/mnloemedehacppeggbipipjlphdjpjcb) .\n\n \n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWe were glad to receive the feedback.

Here's the explanation for the reason that we remove code signing from Notepad++ : 3 years ago DigiCert donated a 3 years code signing certificate to the project, and every good thing has its end, the certificate has been expired since the beginning of this year._\n\n_![NotePad-plus-plus code-signing digital-certiticates](/images/blog/Don-Ho-post.png)_\n\n_I was trying to purchase another certificate with reasonable price. However, I cannot use \"Notepad++\" as CN to sign because Notepad++ doesn’t exist as a company or organization. I wasted hours and hours for getting one suitable certificate instead of working on essential thing - Notepad++ project. I realize that code signing certificate is just an overpriced masturbating toy for FOSS authors -_ \n\n_Notepad++ has done without a certificate for more than 10 years, I don’t see why I should add the dependency now (and be an accomplice of this overpricing industry). I decide to do without it._\n\n_It doesn’t mean there’s no more security in Notepad++, but it will be less flexible for sure:_ _SHA256 hash of Installer and other packages will be provided for every release as usual. Too bad for ugly yellow-orange UAC popup while installation._\n\n_Notepad++ will check the SHA256 of all the components (SciLexer.dll, GUP.exe, and nppPluginList.dll) used by the program.”_\n\nActually, we at CodeNotary.io are in total agreement! That is exactly the reason why **[vChain](http://www.vchain.us)** created and released **CodeNotary**. To provide a valid alternative to the old-fashioned and cumbersome code signing certificates!\n\nDigital Certificates and Certificate Authorities were never meant for code signing. While they might be a nice add-on feature for a large software vendor like Microsoft, smaller software companies need to pay a Digital Certificate tax, just to avoid the MS Windows message popping up. That’s not fair to the smaller software publishers, but more importantly, digital certificates don't’ make the software more secure, while wrongly giving to users the impression that they do.\n\nAs an alternative to code signing certificates, some developers create their own verification pages for MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. Others use GnuPG (GPG) scheme for signing. However, that is just a check-the-box thing, because users downloading the software, still need to manually check and compare the hashes or signatures. Most users never even bother doing that or have any idea how that works.\n\nWe at CodeNotary.io believe that developers and publishers work hard,  create hugely popular software for free, in their spare time. It’s a shame that they get charged a lot of money by digital certificate authorities, only because there are no better alternatives to code signing certificates.\n\nEvery software developer who offers free software should get an autonomously sign their own builds and binaries... for free!  Codenotary.io allows software developers to sign their open source software for free and independently of any authority, due to our use of our blockchain-protected, code-signing product, and best of all, with CodeNotary it’s a simple 1 step process.\n\nSign up for a free Open Source and Freeware developer and publisher:\n\n- **[CodeNotary Solution](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup?license=NON_COMMERCIAL)**\n- **[CodeNotary - Download Verification](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vchain-codenotary-downloa/mnloemedehacppeggbipipjlphdjpjcb)** extension for Chrome\n\nLet's see how simple it is:\n\n\\# vcn login\n\n\\# vcn sign notepad\\_binary.exe\n\nBoom, done!

This blog is about taking an experimental yet scientific methodology and applying it for the sound development of our own Parity Aura blockchain genesis.\n\n \n\nBelow we discuss three different exercises we ran last year in order to determine prerequisites for optimal blockchain genesis.\n\n \n\n## **Exercise 1:** **Genesis with** **1 Boot and 1 Validator Node**\n\n \n\nFor the first exercise, we wanted to see how slowly adding additional nodes and validators would affect blockchain health if we had started with only one boot node and one validator node. After establishing the initial 1:1 pairing of boot nodes to validators, we added 2 more boot nodes to the system and checked.

This time we decided to start with 1 boot node and 2 validators. We then added 10 more nodes and observed as everything continued to sync fine.\n\n \n\nWe then added another 5 nodes as validators starting at a block in the future. Let’s call it block #7. We restarted the nodes one by one but ran into a problem.

File integrity monitoring is a critical security control, that needs to be simple to setup and configure. Furthermore, it needs to be more than a simple change detection. The fundamental technology needs to be tamperproof and the alerting needs to live out of reach of the monitored system.\n\n## A typical file integrity monitoring process\n\nFile integrity process requires the following steps:\n\n1. Set policy: Start by defining your notification policy, identifying which files on which devices need to be monitored.\n2. Baseline files: Make sure you're files are in a good state, before starting the integrity monitoring. Evaluating content, version, creation date and modification date, or any other file attribute is a good start.\n3. Monitor & Reconcile Changes: You may see dozens or hundreds of file changes on a normal day on a single system. Focus on the critical configuration files and binaries is important to avoid notification flooding. The use of ignore lists or well defined monitoring configurations is key.\n4. Alert and action: When unauthorized changes are detected, go for the most critical alerts and take action before more damage is done.\n5. Dashboard: FIM is required for PCI compliance and most other standards. Clear dashboards displaying tamperproof data are vital for operational processes and audit compliance.\n\n## Why is file integrity monitoring important?\n\n- Cloud server are by definition accessible over the internet. Even a small misconfigutation or weakness, can allow unauthorized access. It doesn't matter if you're using Google, Amazon, Azure or a local provider to host your server - you are responsible to protect your systems.\n- File servers are a prime target and at risk of internal and external attacks. Data breaches have the potential to cause massive financial or reputational damage to your organization.\n- The average cost of a lost or stolen record is $148 and some companies made headlines of millions of records leaked due to data breaches.\n- It doesn't really matter if the file change was made by an internal user or external bad guy. What really matters is, if you are able to detect that change immediately or only weeks, months or years later - or maybe never.\n\n## Change detection\n\nIts as simple as \"Every security breach begins with a single change\"!\n\nIts very common for attackers to start with a single change and monitor the system behaviour and if something is added to the log files.\n\nWhen it comes to configuration files, even a small manipulation in one file can put your whole network at risk. File integrity monitoring, is about tracking these changes of files you want to protect.\n\nIt all starts with setting the baseline using the integrity of a file or a whole folder and add alerting to any unexpected change that might point to a security risk or a compromise. Whether it’s a website hack, a phishing scam, malware, ransomware or insider threat, your solution should alert you immediately.\n\n## The importance of a tamperproof system\n\n**_The best file integrity monitoring fails, if someone can either manipulate the baseline or deactivate the alert._**\n\nCodeNotary brings a huge advantage compared to other solutions out there: its base is tamperproof!\n\nThe complete process uses tamperproof storage and alerting systems independent of your systems or environments.\n\n- Whenever a baseline is set, a globally, unique checksum is calculated of the file integrity. Every single bit-change results in a different integrity checksum. That's true for single files and whole directories.\n- The checksum, file or folder attributes and your identity are written to a tamperproof blockchain structure (Distributed Ledger Technology - DLT).\n- The alert configuration is stored in the blockchain-protected CodeNotary environment.\n- CodeNotary services (outside of the monitored systems!) are triggered when a file change happens OR someone tampers with the alerting system.\n- CodeNotary supports a kind of a dead-man switch; when no file or folder verification happen anymore for a certain amount of time, a alert is triggered.\n\n## Set up your first system\n\n### Install CodeNotary vcn\n\nTo start your file integrity monitoring the only requirement is a local installation of the CodeNotary vcn command line. You can find the latest release here:\n\n[https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn)\n\nand the documentation here:\n\n[https://docs.codenotary.io/guide/quickhelp.html](https://docs.codenotary.io/guide/quickhelp.html)\n\n### Register your account to enable file integrity monitoring and alerting\n\n[https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n\nWhen setting up your account, you also create your credentials to start notarizing files and folders. That the notarization process will be used to set the file integrity baseline as well as the alert, when a change is detected.\n\n### Connect your system with the CodeNotary account\n\nTo connect your local system with your CodeNotary identity, you can simply type\n\n![](/images/blog/login.png)\n\nCodeNotary Login\n\n## Create the file integrity baseline\n\nTo setup the first file integrity monitoring alert, just use the vcn notarize command and include the alert flag. In the following example we notarize the network interface config file ([netplan](https://netplan.io/)) as well the SSH (/etc/ssh) folder, that needs integrity monitoring as well.\n\n![](/images/blog/notarize-1024x387.png)\n\nvcn notarize\n\n```\n# notarize netplan configuration file\nvcn notarize --create-alert --alert-name \"netplan config of DESKTOP-82S443U\" /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml\n```\n\n![](/images/blog/notarize-netplan-1024x350.png)\n\nNetPlan config alert set\n\nNow we notarize the /etc/sshfolder as well, to detect any changes to our secure shell settings.\n\n```\nvcn notarize --create-alert --alert-name \"ssh config of DESKTOP-82S443U\" --no-ignore-file dir:///etc/ssh\n```\n\n![](/images/blog/vcn-dir-1024x331.png)\n\nnotarize and protect /etc/ssh\n\nYou might have seen the --no-ignore-file flag. We used that flag to disable the creation of the .vcnignore file inside of the /etc/ssh directory, because our user has no permission to write into that folder. But that also deactivates the change details, like added, modified or deleted file name.\n\nTo make sure the file changes inside the folder (where the user has no write permission) are still tracked, please use the --read-only flag.\n\n```\nvcn notarize --create-alert --alert-name \"ssh config of DESKTOP-82S443U\" --read-only dir:///etc/ssh\n```\n\n![](/images/blog/readonly-1024x356.png)\n\nnotarize read-only directories\n\n### Activate the file integrity monitoring\n\nTo activate the file integrity monitoring, you can simply run the integrity verification check:\n\n```\nvcn authenticate --alerts\n```\n\nIt also makes sense to add that command to your cron job.\n\n```\n# add the following line to /etc/crontab, sudo nano /etc/crontab:\n*/5 * * * * dennis /usr/local/bin/vcn authenticate --alerts\n\n# one command, as elivated user:\necho \"*/5 * * * * username /usr/local/bin/vcn authenticate --alerts\" >> /etc/crontab\n```\n\n**That cron job runs every 5 minutes the CodeNotary authenticate job. As CodeNotary has a \"dead man switch\" built in, an alert will be triggered as well, if no authenticate command will be received for one hour.**\n\n## Check the existing file integrity alerts\n\nWhen logging into the CodeNotary dashboard, you can find your configured file integrity monitoring alerts in the Alerts section. That way you can see all the alerts of all your systems.\n\n![](/images/blog/db-alerts-1024x319.png)\n\nall Alerts are listed in the dashboard\n\nor you can use the vcn command line as well to see just the alerts of the local system:\n\n```\nvcn alerts list\n```\n\n## File integrity changed - triggering the alert\n\nAs long as no one tampered with your files or folders, you don't receive any alerts by email or shown within the dashboard.\n\nBut when the file integrity changes, you immediately get an email alert:\n\n![](/images/blog/alerttriggered-1024x154.png)\n\ntriggered alert inside the CodeNotary dashboard\n\n![](/images/blog/email.png)\n\nemail alert about changed file integrity\n\nFor security reasons, we don't disclose more information, but you can click the dashboard link and login to see all details.\n\nIf you don't want to receive the alerts anymore, you can either acknowledge it or deactivate the alert completely.\n\n**All alert and file integrity data including history is stored immutable, you need to create a new alert if the file or folder changes are ok and intended and deactivate the \"old\" alert.**\n\n## File Integrity Monitoring user\n\nWe definitely recommend to create a special user account for all file integrity checks that never logs in. That way you can enable an even more secure monitoring system to alert you whenever important data are changed.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere is no excuse anymore to have others hijack or manipulate your system configuration files or important data. Using CodeNotary, you get an service that fulfills all the requirements for a secure and tamperproof file integrity monitoring. Protect your cloud services, protect your most important and critical data and set up alerts for any file or folder change that might happen.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/file-integrity-monitoring-change-management","extension":".md","slug":"file-integrity-monitoring-change-management","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624088},"$loki":18},{"title":"Find & Continuously Monitor Your Kubernetes Environment for Unwanted Docker Images","image":"/images/blog/K8s-Grafana-CodeNotary-300x232.png","date":"2019-05-19","toc":[{"id":"getting-started-and-cloning-the-repo","depth":2,"text":"Getting Started and Cloning the Repo"},{"id":"building-our-docker-container","depth":2,"text":"Building Our Docker Container"},{"id":"working-with-our-daemonset","depth":2,"text":"Working with Our DaemonSet"},{"id":"making-the-data-useful","depth":2,"text":"Making the Data Useful"},{"id":"testing-our-prometheus-set-up","depth":2,"text":"Testing Our Prometheus Set Up"},{"id":"visualizing-codenotary-results-and-dashboard-integration","depth":2,"text":"Visualizing CodeNotary Results and Dashboard Integration"},{"id":"trusting-our-docker-images","depth":2,"text":"Trusting Our Docker Images"},{"id":"codenotary-trust-process","depth":2,"text":"CodeNotary Trust Process"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"K8s, Grafana, & CodeNotary","src":"/images/blog/K8s-Grafana-CodeNotary-300x232.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"CodeNotary is the only decentralized, secure and blockchain based Kubernetes solution out there to guarantee the integrity of the containers running in a k8s cluster.

In this blog, we will show you how to find and continuously monitor for unwanted Docker /images/blog in your K8s environment by using CodeNotary and its CLI tool, vcn. We will also show you how you can visualize everything in a Prometheus time series database using Grafana. The blockchain and smart contract based CodeNotary vcn tool allows you to protect your environment so only the containers signed by you (or by another signer you trust) and therefore recognized by you as ones you want to use, will be clearly identifiable as “Trusted”.\n\n \n\nThe applications we will be using/referencing that you should be familiar with in this blog are:\n\n- Docker\n- Kubernetes\n- Prometheus\n- Grafana\n\n \n\nNow, let’s protect our environment.\n\n \n\nTo begin with, you will need to start a free trial with CodeNotary. If you don’t have one yet, you can do so [here](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup).\n\n \n\nOnce you have your free trial up and running, let’s get started.\n\n \n\n \n\n## **Getting Started and Cloning the Repo**\n\n \n\nFirst off, there’s another Github project called [vcn k8s](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn-k8s) we are going to clone. The vcn k8s project is a watchdog that continuously verifies the integrity and authenticity of the containers running in a k8s cluster. To clone, we use:\n\n \n\n**git clone [https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn-k8s](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn-k8s)**\n\n \n\nOnce we have our clone, we change the directory to the correct corresponding folder.\n\n \n\n**cd vcn-k8s**\n\n \n\nRunning a list of the folder contents, we see a Docker Compose file, Dockerfile, Kubernetes DaemonSet, and also the verify.Prometheus.\n\n \n\n![vcn-k8s GitHub folder contents](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-16.11.34-1-300x13.png)\n\n \n\nThe vcn command actually runs inside the pod as we will see later on. Of course, we can check all the files out whenever we want but for now we are going straight into building our container.\n\n \n\n \n\n## **Building Our Docker Container**\n\n \n\nSo we enter the command:\n\n \n\n**docker-compose build**\n\n \n\nAnd now everything gets downloaded and our container is built.\n\n \n\n![](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-16.23.32-300x203.png)\n\n \n\nNext, we want to tag the container and upload it to Docker Hub. In your case, just use your own dockerhub.com account so your code would look like this (below):\n\n \n\n**docker tag 57e9d748995e _(your dockerhub.com account)_/vcn**\n\n \n\nNow, we want to push our container onto Docker Hub.\n\n \n\n**docker push** **_(your dockerhub.com account)_/vcn**\n\n \n\n \n\nWhen the command runs through successfully our Docker image has been uploaded and tagged correctly.\n\n \n\n \n\n## **Working with Our DaemonSet**\n\n \n\nThe next thing we want to do is to change the DaemonSet so that it is going to use the image we just uploaded to DockerHub.\n\n \n\nTo do so we’ll enter the command:\n\n \n\n**vi vcn-k8s-daemonset.yaml**\n\n  Now, let’s get into the DaemonSet.\n\n \n\nHere we find a default image already entered and we will replace it with our own Docker Hub image.\n\n \n\n**spec:\n    containers:\n      \\# securityContext:\n      # privileged: true \n      image: _(your dockerhub.com account)_/vcn:latest**\n\n \n\nOur DaemonSet tells Kubernetes to deploy a pod to every Kubernetes node automatically.\n\n \n\nWe also see the annotation that tells the Prometheus server inside our Kubernetes deployment that the pods can be scraped and port 9581 is used by CodeNotary vcn.\n\n \n\n![annotations](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-19-11.02.01.png)\n\n \n\nWe go ahead and save the Daemonset configuration file to reflect our changes.\n\n \n\nNext, we deploy the Daemonset into Kubernetes using:\n\n \n\n**kubectl apply -f vcn-k8s-daemonset.yaml**\n\n \n\nOnce it has been deployed into Kubernetes, we see:\n\n \n\n![return](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-16.50.20-300x11.png)\n\n \n\nNow, we can check the pods and see if they are running. Specifically, we check for codenotary-vcnverify, which we see below in the first 2 returned lines.\n\n \n\n![pods list](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-16.48.26-300x168.png)\n\n \n\nAnd they are already running. Perfect!\n\n \n\nThat’s basically it. Right? Well, not so much because now we want to visualize the data.\n\n \n\n## **Making the Data Useful**\n\n \n\nCurrently, what happens is that the two pods running are each on one of the Kubernetes nodes.\n\n \n\nSo we need to check if our Prometeus is already scraping the data. With Kubernetes you don’t need to configure it in any way because the cool thing on DaemonSet is that when you have a Prometheus running inside of your Kubernetes, you are able to work with annotations to make sure everything is crawled automatically when the pods go online. This way we can continuously monitor for unwanted and foreign Docker /images/blog in our environment.\n\n \n\nNext, we will check our Prometheus server.\n\n \n\n## **Testing Our Prometheus Set Up**\n\n \n\nFirst, we need to make sure our targets are correct...\n\n \n\n![targets url](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-16.58.01.png)\n\n \n\n...which they are.\n\n \n\nNext, let’s scroll down and check if the Prometheus finds the CodeNotary container and if they are scraped correctly.\n\n \n\n![Prometheus pod](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-17.01.13-300x26.png)\n\n \n\nAt first, the container will appear as down and be listed as invalid. This is because the application needs to detect and verify each running container. After a few seconds, we check it again and the target is up and the data is being scraped.\n\n \n\n![Prometheus pod](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-17.09.20-300x25.png)\n\n \n\nThe 2nd container is still down, but it takes only a couple of seconds before it is also up.\n\n \n\nNow, we can start checking to see if the data is coming in on the Prometheus graph page.\n\n \n\n![Prometheus Graph Page](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-17.11.37-300x177.png)\n\n \n\nWe just go for the vcn verification level metrics.\n\n \n\n![vcn_verification_level query](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-17.13.08.png)\n\n \n\nHere we type vcn\\_verifation\\_level and run the query.\n\n \n\nYes. The data is coming in now. As we can see, we have various containers with the status value indicated for each. (In this demonstration, one of the containers is already signed, which is why we see a different value on one of them i.e. 2 instead of zero.)\n\n \n\n![Prometheus pod status](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-17.15.50-300x85.png)\n\n## **Visualizing CodeNotary Results and Dashboard Integration**\n\n \n\nNow to see how everything is working together, we want to import or create a Grafana dashboard.\n\n \n\nAfter pulling up our dashboard list, we select ‘Import Dashboard’ on the right-hand side.\n\n \n\n![import dashboard](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-17.49.31.png)\n\n \n\nNext, we copy and paste the dashboard JSON file content and load it. Alternatively, we can create the dashboard ourselves based on the Prometheus data.\n\n \n\n![load dashboard JSON file content](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-17.55.30-300x170.png)\n\n \n\nAfter importing the dashboard, we select it in the Grafana dashboard navigation.\n\n \n\n![selecting Grafana dashboard navigation](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-17.59.07-300x78.png)\n\n \n\nAnd here we go! Our 'Container Status' viewer is up.\n\n \n\n![Opvizor container status viewer](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-18.02.49-300x109.png)\n\n \n\nWe see there are non-verifiable and verifiable containers. We can also see after expanding the ‘Container Status’ panel window that the verifiable and non-verifiable containers are labeled as ‘Trusted’ and ‘Unknown’ along the inside right side of the window. Here we can see the container (the 3rd one in the list - netdata/netdata) we will be signing later in this demo is listed as ‘Unknown’.\n\n \n\n![Opvizor container status viewer panel window](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-18.06.25-300x210.png)\n\n \n\n## **Trusting Our Docker Images**\n\n \n\nNext, we want to trust our container /images/blog and mark them to be production ready. In our example, we go for the netdata container. So let’s check what container image is used by the NetData pods with the command:\n\n \n\n**kubectl describe pod netdata-master-0**\n\n \n\nNow, we scroll back up through the description we just retrieved and locate the image that is getting pulled.\n\n \n\n![container image description](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-18.14.01-300x41.png)\n\n \n\nNow, we pull the image ourselves locally in order to sign it using CodeNotady vcn:\n\n \n\n**docker pull netdata/netdata:v1.13.0**\n\n \n\n## **CodeNotary Trust Process**\n\n \n\nThe next step for us is to sign the image with our [CodeNotary vcn tool](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup) so we mark it in an immutable way that we trust this container. Optionally, we can use the switch `--public` if we want to disclose our identity so others can rely on us. As we sign our Docker image, we make sure to add `docker://` in front of the image name (including the tag) as demonstrated below:\n\n \n\n**vcn s --public -y docker://netdata/netdata:v1.13.0**\n\n \n\nNow, we need to put in our vcn credentials for the Keystore (private key) in order to sign the asset onto the CodeNotary blockchain.\n\n \n\n![Key & Key Store Passphrase](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-23-09.31.43-300x28.png)\n\n \n\nHere we go. And now our image is signed!\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary vcn verification](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-21.22.38-300x30.png)\n\n \n\nBefore checking the dashboard, we will verify our local image for good measure.\n\n \n\n**vcn v docker://netdata/netdata:v1.13.0**\n\n \n\nHere we see our image is, in fact, verified as well as we see all of its attributes.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary vcn verified attributes](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-21.25.48-300x60.png)\n\n \n\nIn the dashboard, we can see that our data container is now verified as ’Trusted’.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary vcn verified TRUSTED](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-18-21.32.24-300x9.png)\n\n \n\nUsing CodeNotary `vcn sign`, we can start signing all of the containers /images/blog we approve and trust to run within our Kubernetes environment.\n\n \n\nIt’s as simple as that.\n\n \n\nThere’s a free trial of course. Actually, if you are non-commercial and open source contributor, just sign up with CodeNotary and you can do exactly what we just showed you forever for free.\n\n \n\n \n\n[Yes, Show Me to My Free Trial](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n\n \n\n \n\nIf you liked this tutorial, check out our other integrations [here](https://www.codenotary.io/integrations/).\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/find-continuously-monitor-your-kubernetes-environment-for-unwanted-docker-images","extension":".md","slug":"find-continuously-monitor-your-kubernetes-environment-for-unwanted-docker-images","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624133},"$loki":19},{"title":"Free Continuous Integrity Verification of your Docker Containers","image":"/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-10-14.05.43-291x300.png","date":"2019-05-10","toc":[{"id":"vcn-watchdog-for-container-protection","depth":2,"text":"VCN Watchdog for Container Protection"},{"id":"how-to-use-vcn-watchdog","depth":3,"text":"How to use VCN Watchdog"},{"id":"design-of-vcn-watchdog","depth":3,"text":"Design of VCN Watchdog"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":3,"text":"Conclusion"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Docker Container Tetris","src":"/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-05-10-14.05.43-291x300.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In our last blog ("},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.codenotary.io/verify-the-integrity-of-a-docker-image-for-free-with-codenotary/","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"here)"}]},{"type":"text","value":", we showed how to sign and verify your build code.

With an established baseline, we’ll move on to the really cool stuff that will make your life a whole lot easier. Below are the few, simple steps you can take to get next level, free continuous integrity verification of your [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/) containers. This way as a developer anytime you execute a Docker run command for any over your numerous containers, you can be sure your code is 100% safe the way you intended it to be.\n\n \n\n## **VCN Watchdog for Container Protection**\n\n \n\nWe developed VCN Watchdog so you can maintain continuous verification of your Docker runtime environment. Watchdog continuously monitors your environment in order to prevent unknown and/or compromised containers from being executed.\n\n \n\n### **How to use VCN Watchdog**\n\n \n\nOne of the great things about VCN Watchdog is it can monitor any functionality you want and alert you accordingly.\n\n \n\nCheck out the project and edit the `verify` file by customizing your monitoring alerts to whatever you want.\n\n \n\nYou will need to make sure your /var/run/docker.sock is accessible.\n\n \n\nThen run this on your server:\n\n \n\n \n\n**docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d**\n\nAnd you are good to go.\n\n \n\n### **Design of VCN Watchdog**\n\n \n\nThis tool is designed as a sidecar for your existing Docker runtime environment. All running containers are continuously checked via CodeNotary vcn for integrity. If a container fails the verification check, then a customizable alert is triggered and you will be notified.\n\n \n\n### **Conclusion** \n\n \n\nThat’s it. Now you know how to get **free continuous integrity verification** of your Docker containers. It really is that simple.\n\n \n\nThanks to the innovative use of **blockchain and smart contract technology**, you now can iterate faster, more securely and at lower costs. Gaining immutable integrity using the CodeNotary vcn tool saves you from a lot of headaches and remediation costs. Additional ways CodeNotary benefits you include:\n\n- Increased Customer Confidence\n- Increased Productivity/Less Remediation\n- Never Before Available Customer Insights\n\n \n\nSee how you can protect your Docker builds continuously with CodeNotary by clicking below to start your free trial.

It's highly recommended to use authenticate only with org or signer flags.\n\n**vcn a help**:\n\n```\n  -I, --org string         accept only authentications matching the passed organisation's ID,\n                           if set no SignerID can be used\n                           (overrides VCN_ORG env var, if any)\n  -s, --signerID strings   accept only authentications matching the passed SignerID(s)\n                           (overrides VCN_SIGNERID env var, if any)\n```\n\n## Build the image\n\nWe're going to build the container image and push it just with the hash, but no additional tagging. That's going to happen in a later step.\n\n```\nBuild:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - >\n      docker build\n      --pull\n      --build-arg VCS_REF=$CI_COMMIT_SHA\n      --build-arg VCS_URL=$CI_PROJECT_URL\n      --tag $CONTAINER_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA\n      .\n    - docker push $CONTAINER_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA\n```\n\n## Notarize the container image\n\nThat's is mainly a copy of the authentication steps from the other build steps before. The reason is, that you can't know if its just one or different GitLab Runner that pick up the tasks - so we make sure, they always are at the same stage:\n\n```\n# notarize container\nNotarize:\n  stage: notarize\n  script:\n    - apk add --no-cache curl\n    - curl -L -o /tmp/vcn https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/releases/download/v0.7.3/vcn-v0.7.3-linux-amd64-static\n    - CHECKSUM=$(sha256sum /tmp/vcn | cut -d \" \" -f 1)\n    - echo $CHECKSUM\n    - curl -s https://api.codenotary.io/authenticate/$CHECKSUM?org=vchain.us | grep -q :0\n    - chmod +x /tmp/vcn\n    - VCN_USER=$codenotary_user VCN_PASSWORD=$codenotary_pass /tmp/vcn login\n    - VCN_NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD=$codenotary_pass /tmp/vcn n --attr GitLab=\"$CI_COMMIT_SHA\" docker://$CONTAINER_IMAGE:latest \n```\n\n## Push the image\n\nThe last steps are about pushing the newly build container image with different tags, the checksum (reference to the GitLab job) and latest.\n\n```\n# Here, the goal is to tag the \"master\" branch as \"latest\"\nPush latest:\n  variables:\n    GIT_STRATEGY: none\n  stage: push\n  only:\n    # Only \"master\" should be tagged \"latest\"\n    - master\n  script:\n    # no guarantee that this job will be picked up by the same runner \n    # that built the image in the previous step, pull it again locally\n    - docker pull $CONTAINER_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA\n    # Then we tag it \"latest\"\n    - docker tag $CONTAINER_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA $CONTAINER_IMAGE:latest\n    # push it.\n    - docker push $CONTAINER_IMAGE:latest\n\nPush tag:\n  variables:\n    GIT_STRATEGY: none\n  stage: push\n  only:\n    # run on tags only.\n    - tags\n  script:\n    - docker pull $CONTAINER_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA\n    - docker tag $CONTAINER_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA $CONTAINER_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME\n    - docker push $CONTAINER_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME\n```\n\n## Result\n\nMake sure to notarize the repository commits, when changing the .gitlab-ci.yml file, as that change will also stop the container image from being build - Security first!\n\nIf all went well, you should be able to get nice green checks for every single pipeline step.\n\n![Trusted GitLab CI/CD](/images/blog/result-1024x542.png)\n\nIn another blog post we'll also cover how you can auto-deploy into Kubernetes and use the [Kube-Notary](https://github.com/vchain-us/kube-notary) integration to make the 360 degree security cycle complete.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/fully-trusted-gitlab-pipeline","extension":".md","slug":"fully-trusted-gitlab-pipeline","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624171},"$loki":21},{"title":"GitHub Actions go live Nov 13th and so do our Verify actions","image":"/images/blog/marketplace-1024x599.png","date":"2019-10-31","toc":[{"id":"github-actions-ga-free-quantities","depth":2,"text":"GitHub Actions GA free quantities"},{"id":"github-actions-marketplace","depth":2,"text":"GitHub Actions marketplace"},{"id":"verify-the-authenticity-of-your-commits-with-codenotaryio","depth":2,"text":"Verify the authenticity of your commits with CodeNotary.io"},{"id":"usage","depth":2,"text":"Usage"},{"id":"inputs","depth":2,"text":"Inputs"},{"id":"sign--notarize-your-git-commit","depth":2,"text":"Sign / Notarize your Git Commit"},{"id":"sources","depth":2,"text":"Sources"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"GitHub Actions go live on November 13th and we're in the last 2 weeks of the beta."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Being part of the GitHub Actions beta program allowed us to create our CodeNotary commit authentication for the GitHub Actions marketplace.

Developers no longer need to depend on 3rd parties to manage their certificates effectively and efficiently. Now, in a matter of seconds, not weeks, code and digital assets can be assigned trust and have their trust verified or even removed when necessary. In this blog, we’ll cover assets and asset integrity management using the CodeNotary dashboard.\n\n \n\n## **What is an asset?**\n\nIn CodeNotary terms, an asset is anything digital that is made up of 1’s and 0’s. Of course, the binary level is as base as it gets and there are scaled degrees of larger digital scaffolding of all sizes including snippets, /images/blog, containers, programs, apps, backups, etc. All assets can have their digital integrity authenticated anytime, anywhere. And CodeNotary’s dashboard makes it easy to manage all your assets in the same place.\n\n \n\n## **Asset Integrity Management and the CodeNotary Dashboard**\n\nAuthenticating integrity is where it all starts. But the power of CodeNotary is just getting started. Once an asset has been signed by you (or your organization), it will appear in your dashboard where you can maintain an overview of your entire asset portfolio. (In fact, if you are using CodeNotary’s vcn tool for Kubernetes you can get a specialized dashboard by using Grafana, which you can see an example of [here](https://twitter.com/CodeNotary/status/1139176271718563840).)\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary Dashboard 2](/images/blog/CodeNotary-Dashboard-2-300x92.png)\n\n \n\nIn it you will be able to see your top assets, the number of verifications they have had, when they were signed, their public visibility, and more as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n \n\nThis is great for when you need to quickly check assets stats as well as an itemized list of all of your assets, their trust statuses, and the number of asset signatures you have revoked due to bugs, obsolescence, or depreciation. (For more on revocation, check our our blog [here](https://www.codenotary.io/the-failure-of-the-certificate-revocation-list-crl/).)\n\n \n\nYou can get extremely granular with the assets you sign. This means that not only are you able to sign a deployed product, but you can sign each component and the components of a component to the _nth_ degree. For DevOps, it doesn’t get any better than being able to verify the integrity of assets on an infinitely granular level.\n\n## **Asset Version Grouping**\n\nWith CodeNotary, you have always had the ability to see in your dashboard every asset you’ve ever signed. Now you are able to easily visualize your asset versions by turning on the ‘Group by Asset' feature for a cleaner dashboard experience. This will group all versions of the same asset together by matching their hashes together. The latest signed version will always be presented first. Clicking the down arrow icon to the left of the asset’s name will cause the asset timeline to display and open up an accordion view of the asset history as shown below.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary - Dashboard - Asset Grouping](/images/blog/4-300x188.png)\n\n \n\n## **How to Turn On Asset Grouping**\n\nYou can sign the same asset, for example putty.exe, or whatever you choose, multiple times. On the Dashboard under the ‘My Assets’ screen, you can choose to see the different versions of your asset grouped or ungrouped by toggling between the two choices.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary - Group by Asset - Toggle](/images/blog/Group-by-Asset-Toggle-300x189.png)\n\n \n\nWhen a user clicks on the little ‘i’ icon to the far right in the row of a specific asset, a detail page will pop up with all the asset's details, including metadata and custom attributes.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary - Dashboard - Asset Details Pop Up](/images/blog/Asset-Details-Pop-Up-300x196.png)\n\n \n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThese new features present a great way to oversee your trusted assets easily. CodeNotary is a ready-to-go reliable solution for asset integrity management. We always recommend following security best practices whenever you want to rely on a certificate, but in case you want to take your development process to the next level, the thoroughness and near instantaneousness of blockchain technology, which CodeNotary is based on, can help you achieve robust integrity in your organization’s DevOps process.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/going-beyond-digital-certificates-with-devops-asset-integrity-management","extension":".md","slug":"going-beyond-digital-certificates-with-devops-asset-integrity-management","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624192},"$loki":23},{"title":"GPG Certificates Maybe Permanently Poisoned but Blockchain Offers a Strong Alternative","image":"/images/blog/lock-unlocked-with-fingerprint.jpeg","date":"2019-08-20","toc":[{"id":"what-happened","depth":2,"text":"What Happened"},{"id":"what-is-a-keyserver","depth":2,"text":"What is a Keyserver"},{"id":"keyserver-vulnerabilities","depth":2,"text":"Keyserver Vulnerabilities"},{"id":"effects-of-the-attack","depth":2,"text":"Effects of the Attack"},{"id":"gpg-response","depth":2,"text":"GPG Response"},{"id":"what-is-a-web-key-directory","depth":2,"text":"What is a Web Key Directory?"},{"id":"summary-of-the-attack","depth":2,"text":"Summary of the Attack"},{"id":"codenotary-blockchain-based-integrity-as-a-service","depth":2,"text":"CodeNotary, Blockchain-based Integrity as a Service"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"lock unlocked with fingerprint","src":"/images/blog/lock-unlocked-with-fingerprint.jpeg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"GPG has been running with a well-known security flaw for a decade, never got around to fixing the problem, and continued to act as a solution for trust and security"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Recently, an attack took place that resulted in the indefinite, possibly permanent, corruption of the GPG public network.

This way, when a digital asset indicates it was signed by, for example, Oracle, users outside of Oracle can know with confidence that Oracle indeed signed the digital asset they want to use.\n\n \n\nLet’s look at an example.\n\n \n\nSay user@org.com is member of [org.com](http://org.com) and user@org.com uses his pubkey, that has been associated with the organization, to sign an asset. \n\nA user can verify an asset against an organization by using the command: \n\n \n\nvcn verify <file> --org=<organization name>\n\n \n\nPeople can also verify the asset’s integrity by using the pubkey of user@org.com with the command `vcn verify --key`.

Be sure to note how the video ends with all but one container verification failing, which is exactly as it should be since only one container was signed in the demo.\n\nRisk surrounds everyone everyday. For coders, risk is especially important to pay attention to as the fallout from a compromise can cause huge damage blows to a well crafted and hard won reputation. Hacks, especially ones that could have been prevented in the first place by employing simple security measures, have a particularly nasty sting to them. This blog will take you through some of the differences and similarities between Docker and Kubernetes and how these container management tools can be maliciously altered. It will also demonstrate how you can protect yourself from using potentially compromised /images/blog and save yourself and your company a lot of time and money by avoiding the otherwise inevitable aftermath cleanup.\n\n \n\n## **When Would You Use Docker or Kubernetes**\n\n \n\nContainers are a way of packaging software so applications can be isolated from the rest of the system. Using them makes runs and reruns predictable and repeatable. Though both Docker and Kubernetes utilize containers, they are not the same. They can both run independently and without having to leverage the benefits of the other. However, together the are greater than the sum of their parts and much more powerful.\n\n \n\nSpecifically, Docker is a containerization software that can stand alone or work with other applications. It can work on any computer, anywhere and is used to run, create and manage containers on a single operating system.\n\n \n\nIt’s when you want to level up your applications to run multiple containers across numerous systems that Kubernetes comes in. Kubernetes (K8s) helps by managing the symphonic orchestration of containers so you don’t have to manually mess around with nailing start times, storage requirements, synchronizing communications, or dealing with component failures. In short, it reduces the operational headache of juggling a multitude of responsibilities through automation.\n\n \n\n## **How a Container Image Can Be Compromised**\n\n \n\nWith so much complexity happening under the hood, it’s easy to understand how security concerns can mount. As the old adage goes in engineering, “The more moving parts you have, the more chances you have for something to go wrong.” At extremely high levels with some of the most complex systems out there today, think AI, it’s not even possible to check the entire system for errors until after a problem event has happened. However, it is not a recommended best practice when the choice between proactive and reactive is available.\n\n \n\nBut back to the topic. Regardless of the amount of security checks that are in place, if a dev is pulling code without any trust, integrity, or authenticity scheme in place, they are essentially inviting an attack to happen.\n\n \n\n## **Examples of Compromised Container Images**\n\n \n\nAs they say, history has a tendency to repeat itself. It’s no different with repositories. Just within the last 2 years, there were several Python and npm compromises that were discovered in addition to several at DockerHub. Incredibly, some vulnerabilities remained live for up to and beyond a full year _after_ their discovery.\n\n \n\nIn fact, some affected servers may still be compromised as hackers could have obtained persistence by creating new backdoors during the compromised period to give themselves unknown system entry in the future. Pulling and using unvetted container /images/blog is basically like swimming with chum in shark infested waters where the sharks can come back for seconds anytime.\n\n \n\n## **How CodeNotary Can Protect You From Using Compromised Images**\n\n \n\n![190530 - How CodeNotary Can Protect You From Using Compromised Container Images](/images/blog/190530-How-CodeNotary-Can-Protect-You-From-Using-Compromised-Container-Images-300x181.png)\n\n \n\nTo protect your reputation for developing clean code, one of the things you’ll want to do is use a tool to verify the integrity of you builds and their components. CodeNotary's blockchain based tool not only has the ability to sign and verify code instantly, but it can do so across hosting services. So regardless, if you are pulling /images/blog from DockerHub, 3rd party libraries, or any other service, CodeNotary can verify them all with the same immutable integrity.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, there are even multiple ways to verify when first downloading an image including using the:\n\n- Drag and drop on the CodeNotary verification page [here](https://verify.codenotary.io) , or\n- Command line interface (which you can get from GitHub [here](https://github.com/vchain-us)), or\n- Google Chrome Extension that auto-verify any image or file you download (which you can get [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vchain-codenotary-downloa/mnloemedehacppeggbipipjlphdjpjcb?hl=en)).\n\n \n\nFor ongoing continuous verification, there are several integrations (including Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, and Jenkins, with more on the way) we have created for users which you can see [here](https://www.codenotary.io/integrations/).\n\n \n\n## **How to Sign a Docker Container Image - Demo Video**\n\n \n\nThe below demonstration video shows all the steps for the specific use case of signing a local Docker container image so vcn, the CodeNotary CLI tool, can verify the image’s integrity. Steps shown include:\n\n \n\n1. Login using vcn login\n2. Check the local Docker container image\n3. Sign the container image with the CodeNotary account using vcn sign\n4. Verify the container image using vcn verify\n5. Check the vcn pod (Kubernetes DaemonSet) log if the verification works\n\n \n\nBe sure to note how the video ends with all but one container verification failing, which is exactly as it should be since only one container was signed in the demo. You can see the demo on ‘How to Sign a Docker Container Image’ [here](https://asciinema.org/a/BEHSBE7gS8Q4zB43lEKpMd47J).\n\n \n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n \n\nIn the end, there are always risks in using software and containers, but having the right mindset, the right security practices, and the right tools from the start of the dev lifecycle can mitigate your risk exposure levels significantly.\n\n \n\nIf you like, you can try out CodeNotary’s Verification tool for yourself by clicking below.

Whenever some digital object is too large for email or chat, people use either cloud storage service (like OneDrive or Dropbox) or services like WeTransfer. It's free, very convenient and only a browser is required.\n\n## Sending files or documents using WeTransfer\n\n![WeTransfer](/images/blog/wetransfer_send-1-1024x879.png)\n\nYou only need to provide a sender and a receiver email address, the file(s) and some optional text. When clicking transfer, the upload to the WeTransfer service starts and an email is triggered to the recipient.\n\n![](/images/blog/transfer.png)\n\n## Receiving the documents and files using WeTransfer\n\nThe recipient gets an email with the download link and the details about the sender (email) and the additional information. You can simply click on the link or the button within the email to download the files from the WeTransfer service. The files will be there for one week when using the free service.\n\n![](/images/blog/email.png)\n\n## Who did send the files?\n\nWell, it's written in the email! Actually when you only received files so far and don't know WeTransfer or never send any files, that might be an obvious idea. **The bitter truth is - you have no idea!**\n\n![](/images/blog/form.png)\n\nThe WeTransfer form inputs are simple text fields and there is no check if the sender is really the sender. You can easily send a file using customerservice@amazon.com or something like that.\n\n![](/images/blog/fake.png)\n\nthe sender email is a simple text field\n\nSome bad guy can simply use that service to send you malicious files using a sender email that is known to you or makes it more likely for you to download and click the files.\n\n## Add trust to WeTransfer and other services\n\nLuckily there is a free service you can use to add trust to WeTransfer: [CodeNotary.io](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n\n**CodeNotary adds signer information to the globally unique identity of any digital asset - tamperproof and immutable.**\n\nBefore or right after sending files (no matter what size) to others, notarize them additionally and inform the recipient how to check if you know and trust these files. Using https://authenticate.codenotary.io, everyone can check the notarization status of files or documents.\n\n**Important security information**: all CodeNotary services are processing the files on your computer or in your browser. Files are never uploaded or transferred to any service outside of your computer.\n\nNot notarized (or trusted):\n\n![](/images/blog/notarize-no.png)\n\n## Notarize the file using Windows\n\nYou can download the Windows installer for CodeNotary here: [https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/releases](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/releases)\n\nor in your CodeNotary dashboard:\n\n![CodeNotary Windows Setup](/images/blog/vcn-1024x447.png)\n\nThen simply notarize the files using the context menu of Windows Explorer:\n\n![Notarize a file](/images/blog/notarize.png)\n\nWhen the file is notarized anyone can authenticate and check the trust level of the file:\n\n![](/images/blog/trusted.png)\n\nThe next time you send a file using WeTransfer and you want to protect yourself and others from fraud and malicious behavior, simply use CodeNotary and add the following to the description text:\n\n**Please verify the authenticity of this file and if it has been trusted by drag and dropping into your browser at https://authenticate.codenotary.io and check for the thumb's up logo.**\n\nWe definitely recommend to further limit the verification by adding your signer ID or organization:\n\n### Different ways to further protect authenticate\n\nThere are three different ways to let people authenticate using https://authenticate.codenotary.io\n\n1. simply check if someone notarized the files (good enough, if you produced the file) - [https://authenticate.codenotary.io](https://authenticate.codenotary.io)\n2. check if a member of an organization (or company) notarized:  \n    https://authenticate.codenotary.io/org/domain (example: [https://authenticate.codenotary.io/org/vchain.us](https://authenticate.codenotary.io/org/vchain.us))\n3. check if an individual notarized (most secure) using the signer id:  \n    https://authenticate.codenotary.io/signer/signerid (example: [https://authenticate.codenotary.io/signer/0xebe546f431bbc785b2cfc30e649d4f38f9a087bb](https://authenticate.codenotary.io/signer/0xebe546f431bbc785b2cfc30e649d4f38f9a087bb))\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/howto-trust-wetransfer-when-sending-or-receiving-files","extension":".md","slug":"howto-trust-wetransfer-when-sending-or-receiving-files","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624252},"$loki":28},{"title":"Run immudb on Raspberry Pi and other ARM systems","date":"2020-10-01","image":"/images/blog/raspberry-pi.jpg","tags":["ARM","Raspberry","immudb"],"toc":[{"id":"arm-64-bit","depth":2,"text":"ARM 64-Bit"},{"id":"arm-32-bit","depth":2,"text":"ARM 32-Bit"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"immudb-support-for-arm-architectures"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#immudb-support-for-arm-architectures","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"immudb support for ARM architectures"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It's exciting to learn that more and more projects are using immudb as their core immutable data storage.

immudb support for ARM architectures\n\nIt's exciting to learn that more and more projects are using immudb as their core immutable data storage. Different projects also mean different deployments and requirements.\nOne of the latest requests we received, is the support for ARM architecture. Besides running immudb on ARM server hardware, some IoT projects are looking into smaller systems as well, like a Raspberry Pi.\n\nReason is, that IoT produces a lot of sensor data that are the being used to make decisions. Therefore, it is important to to store that data at least for a certain amount of time, tamperproof.\nMost IoT and embedded systems run on ARM, MIPS or RISC-V architectures. \n\n\nAs ARM is the most popular platform, we started to compile and test immudb for ARM architecture and want to share the good news.\n\n## ARM 64-Bit\n\nimmudb is written in Go and designed to run on 64-Bit systems. That made it very straighforward to compile it for ARM systems.\n\n\nSimply clone the immudb repository on your system (best to have a Go development environment there as well) and run:\n\n`GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 make immudb-static`\n\nYou can copy and run the immudb binary on your ARM 64 Bit system (Linux in the example above):\n\n\n## ARM 32-Bit\n\n![ARM 32-Bit](/images/blog/immudb-arm.jpg)\n\n32-Bit wasn't part of our initial design, but it didn't took us long to make it 32-Bit ready.\nFor now you can find the 32-Bit version in a separate branch, but that is going to change soon.\n\nhttps://github.com/codenotary/immudb/tree/feat/arch32\n\nTo compile it:\n\n```bash\ngit clone -b feat/arch32 https://github.com/codenotary/immudb\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=arm make immudb-static\n```\n\nAfter compiling immudb successfully, you can copy the binary to your Raspberry Pi and run it.\n\n```bash\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ file immudb\nimmudb: ELF 32-bit LSB

A minimalist API is exposed for applications while cryptographic verifications and state update protocol implementation are fully implemented by this client.  Latest validated immudb state may be keep in the local filesystem when initialising the client with the rootPath option, please read [immudb research paper] for details of how immutability is ensured by [immudb].\n\n[grpc]: https://grpc.io/\n[immudb research paper]: https://immudb.io/\n[immudb]: https://immudb.io/\n[immudb-node repository]: https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-node\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nimmudb-node assumes an already running immudb server. Running `immudb` is quite simple, please refer to the\nfollowing link for downloading and running it: https://docs.immudb.io/quickstart.html\n\n## Installation\n\nJust include immudb-node as a dependency in your project:\n```\nconst ImmudbClient = require('immudb-node')\n```\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nimmudb-node supports the [latest immudb release].\n\n[latest immudb release]: https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases/tag/v0.8.0\n\n## Quickstart\n\nCheck out some [examples]\n\n[examples]: https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-client-examples/tree/master/node\n\n## Step by step guide\n\n### Creating a Client\n\nThe following code snippets shows how to create a client.\n\nUsing default configuration:\n```\nconst config = {\n  address: '127.0.0.1:3322',\n  rootPath: '.',\n}\n\nImmudbClient(config, (err, cl) => {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.log(err)\n  }\n\n  // Interact with the client.\n})\n```\n\n### User sessions\n\nUse `login` and `logout` methods to initiate and terminate user sessions:\n\n```\ntry {\n  await cl.login({ username: 'usr1', password: 'pwd1' })\n\n  // Interact with immudb using logged user.\n\n  await cl.logout()\n} catch (err) {\n  console.log(err)\n}\n```\n\nOr with callbacks\n```\ncl.login({ username: 'usr1', password: 'pwd1' }, (err, res) => {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.log(err)\n  }\n\n  // Interact with immudb using logged user.\n\n  cl.logout(null, (err, res) => {\n    if (err) {\n      return console.log(err)\n    })\n    // Logged out.\n})\n```\n\n### Creating a database\n\nCreating a new database is quite simple:\n\n```\ncl.createDatabase('db1')\n```\n\n### Setting the active database\n\nSpecify the active database with:\n\n```\ncl.useDatabase('db1')\n```\n\n### Traditional read and write\n\nimmudb provides read and write operations that behave as a traditional\nkey-value store i.e. no cryptographic verification is done. This operations\nmay be used when validations can be post-poned:\n\n```\nlet res = await cl.set({ key: 'key1', value: 'value1' })\nconsole.log(res.index)\n\nres = await cl.get({ key: 'key1' })\nconsole.log(res.key, res.value, res.index)\n```\n\n### Verified or Safe read and write\n\nimmudb provides built-in cryptographic verification for any entry. The client\nimplements the mathematical validations while the application uses as a traditional\nread or write operation:\n\n```\ntry {\n  let res = await cl.safeSet({ key: 'key1', value: 'value1' })\n  console.log(res.index)\n\n  res = await cl.safeGet({ key: 'key1' })\n  console.log(res.key, res.value, res.index)\n} catch (err) {\n  if (err.clientErr == cl.proofErr) {\n    // Proof does not verify.\n  }\n  console.log(err)\n}\n```\n\n### Multi-key read and write\n\nTransactional multi-key read and write operations are supported by immudb and immudb-node.\n\nAtomic multi-key write (all entries are persisted or none):\n\n```\n  req = {\n    skvList: [{\n      key: 'key1',\n      payload: 'value1',\n      timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now()/100),\n    },{\n      key: 'key2',\n      payload: 'value2',\n      timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now()/100),\n    }]\n  }\n  res = await cl.setBatchSV(req)\n```\n\nAtomic multi-key read (all entries are retrieved or none):\n```\n    req = {\n      keys: [{\n        key: 'key1',\n      },{\n        key: 'key2',\n      }],\n    }\n    res = await cl.getBatchSV(req)\n```\n\n### Closing the client\n\nTo programatically close the connection with immudb server use the `shutdown` operation:\n \n ```\n cl.shutdown()\n ```\n\nNote: after shutdown, a new client needs to be created to establish a new connection.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions.

A minimalist API is exposed for applications while cryptographic\nverifications and state update protocol implementation are fully implemented by this client.\nLatest validated immudb state may be kept in the local filesystem when using default `rootService`,\nplease read [immudb research paper] for details of how immutability is ensured by [immudb].\n\n[grpc]: https://grpc.io/\n[immudb research paper]: https://immudb.io/\n[immudb]: https://immudb.io/\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nimmu-py assumes there is an existing instance of the immudb server up and running. Running `immudb` is quite simple, please refer to the\nfollowing link for downloading and running it: https://immudb.io/docs/quickstart.html\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the package using pip:\n\n```shell\n    pip install git+https://github.com/codenotary/immu-py.git\n```\n\n Then import the client as follows:\n\n```python\n    from immudb.client import ImmudbClient\n```\n\nNote: immu-py is currently hosted in [Github Packages].\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nimmu-py supports the [latest immudb release].\n\n[latest immudb release]: https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases/tag/v0.7.1\n\n## Quickstart\n\n[Hello Immutable World!] example can be found in `immudb-client-examples` repo.\n\n[Hello Immutable World!]: https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-client-examples/tree/master/python\n\n## Step by step guide\n\n### Creating a Client\n\nThe following code snippets shows how to create a client.\n\nUsing default configuration:\n\n```python\n    client = ImmudbClient()\n```\n\nSetting `immudb` url and port:\n\n```python\n\n    client = ImmudbClient(\"mycustomurl:someport\")\n    client = ImmudbClient(\"10.105.20.32:8899\")\n```\n\n### User sessions\n\nUse `login` and `logout` methods to initiate and terminate user sessions:\n\n```python\n    client.login(\"usr1\", \"pwd1\");\n\n    // Interact with immudb using logged user\n\n    client.logout();\n```\n### Encoding\n\nPlease note that, in order to provide maximum flexibility, all functions accept byte arrays as parameters. Therefore, unicode strings must be properly encoded.\nIt is possible to store structured objects, but they must be serialized (e.g., with pickle or json).\n\n### Creating a database\n\nCreating a new database is quite simple:\n\n```python\n    client.createDatabase(b\"db1\");\n```\n\n### Setting the active database\n\nSpecify the active database with:\n\n```python\n    client.useDatabase(b\"db1\");\n```\nIf not specified, the default databased used is \"defaultdb\".\n\n### Traditional read and write\n\nimmudb provides read and write operations that behave as a traditional\nkey-value store i.e. no cryptographic verification is done. This operations\nmay be used when validations can be post-poned:\n\n```python\n    client.set(b\"k123\", b\"value123\");\n    result = client.get(b\"k123\");\n```\n\n### Verified or Safe read and write\n\nimmudb provides built-in cryptographic verification for any entry. The client\nimplements the mathematical validations while the application uses as a traditional\nread or write operation:\n\n```python\n    try:\n        client.safeSet(b\"k123\", new byte[]{1, 2, 3});\n        results = client.safeGet(b\"k123\");\n    Except VerificationException as e:\n        # Do something\n```\n\n### Multi-key read and write\n\nTransactional multi-key read and write operations are supported by immudb and immupy.\nAtomic multi-key write (all entries are persisted or none):\n\n```python\n    normal_dictionary = {b\"key1\": b\"value1\", b\"key2\": b\"value2\"}\n    client.setAll(normal_dictionary);\n```\n\nAtomic multi-key read (all entries are retrieved or none):\n\n```python\n    normal_dictionary = {b\"key1\": b\"value1\", b\"key2\": b\"value2\"}\n    results_dictionary = client.getAll(normal_dictionary.keys())\n    # Or manually\n    client.get([b\"key1\", b\"key2\"])\n```\n## User management\nUsers can be added and granted access to databases.\n\n### Adding a user\nThe ```createUser``` functions create a new users and grants the specified permission to a database.\n```python\nuser='newuser'\npassword='Pw1:pasdfoiu'\npermission=immudb.constants.PERMISSION_RW\ndatabase='defaultdb'\n\nclient.createUser(user, password, permission, database)\n```\n\nThe database must exists at the time the user is created. The password must be between 8 and 32 characters in length, and must have at least one upper case letter, a symbol and a digit.\n\nPermission are defined in immudb.constants and are:\n\n- `PERMISSION_SYS_ADMIN`\n- `PERMISSION_ADMIN`\n- `PERMISSION_NONE`\n- `PERMISSION_R`\n- `PERMISSION_RW`\n\n### Changing password\nThe user must must provide both old and new password:\n```python\nnewPassword=\"pW1:a0s98d7gfy\"\nresp=client.changePassword(user, newPassword, oldPassword)\n```\nIt is applied the same password policy of user creation.\n\n### User list\n\nTo get the list of user created on immudb, simply call ```listUsers```:\n```python\nresp=client.listUsers()\nprint(users.userlist.users)\n```\n\n### Closing the client\n\nTo programatically close the connection with immudb server use the `shutdown` operation:\n\n```python\n    client.shutdown();\n```\n\nNote: after shutdown, a new client needs to be created to establish a new connection.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions.

v0.8.0 - atomic multi-key operations, cryptographic root signing and new SDKs\n\nThe release sets the basis to support complex use cases with an enhanced security model:\n\n- Atomic multi-key insertion: all entries are applied or none. Built-in atomicity provides the support needed to deal with multiple entities or complex entities mapped into several keys.\n- Cryptographic root signing: this feature is now incorporated into the state update protocol to guarantee any single client or auditor is able to irrefutable demonstrate any tampering. \n- Updated Java SDK [immudb4j](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j) with step-by-step guides and running samples\n- All new SDKs for Python [immudb-py](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-py), Node.js [immudb-node](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-node), .net [immudb4dotnet](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4dotnet)\n\nThanks again to the community for great feedback, real-life testing and confirming our performance tests.\n\n# Changelog\n\n<a

We're proud to announce the first Release Candidate of immudb!\n\nAfter months of hard work, the team felt immudb is ready for the open source community. We focussed on security, performance and also ease of installation and use. With the release candidate published, we're really looking forward to get feedback.\n\nIf you want to get all details right now, please check out our Github repository (if you like it please give us a star as well): [immudb](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb)\n\n## What is immudb?\n\nimmudb is **lightweight, high-speed immutable database** for systems and applications. With immmudb you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes indelibly in a the tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of, say, your debit/credit transactions.[![](/images/blog/immudb-mascot-small.png)](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/blob/master/img/immudb-mascot-small.png)\n\nTraditional transaction logs are hard to scale, and are not immutable. So there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised.\n\nAs such immudb provides **unparalleled insights** **retro-actively**, of what happened to your sensitive data, even if your perimiter was compromised. immudb provides the guarantatee of immutability by using internally a **Merkle tree structure**.\n\nimmudb gives you the same **cyrptographic verification** of the integrity of data written with **SHA-256** like classic blockhain without the cost and complexity associated with blockchains today.\n\nimmudb has 4 main benefits:\n\n1. **immudb is immutable**. You can only add records, but **never change or delete records**.\n2. data stored in immudb is **cryptographically coherent and verifiable**, like blockchains, just without all the complexity and at high speed.\n3. Anyone can get **started with immudb in minutes**. Wether in node.js, Java, Python, Golang, .Net, or any other language. It's very easy to use and you can have your immutable database running in just a few minutes.\n4. Finally, immudb is **Open Source**. You can run it **on premise**, or in the **cloud** and it's completely free. immudb is governed by the Apache 2.0 License.\n\nimmudb is currently runs on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, **Windows**, and **MacOS**, along with other systems derived from them, such as **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.\n\n## **immudb High-level**\n\n[![immudb Highlevel](/images/blog/highlevel.png \"immudb highlevel overview\")](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/blob/master/img/highlevel.png)\n\n[![Tweet about immudb!](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/65fd47cbaab26b81c38adc03ebb86ee9dd42cb5f/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f747769747465722f75726c2f687474702f736869656c64732e696f2e7376673f7374796c653d736f6369616c266c6162656c3d547765657425323061626f7574253230696d6d756462)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=immudb:%20lightweight,%20high-speed%20immutable%20database!&url=https://github.com/codenotary/immudb)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/immudb-release-candidate-0-6-0","extension":".md","slug":"immudb-release-candidate-0-6-0","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624433},"$loki":37},{"title":"First steps to use Java SDK for immudb — the open source immutable database","date":"2020-08-20","image":"/images/blog/java-640x360.jpg","tags":["SDK","Java"],"toc":[{"id":"setup-immudb","depth":2,"text":"Setup immudb"},{"id":"immudb-dockerhub","depth":3,"text":"immudb Dockerhub"},{"id":"standalone-binaries","depth":3,"text":"standalone Binaries"},{"id":"install-immudb-as-a-service","depth":3,"text":"install immudb as a service"},{"id":"where-to-find-the-official-java-sdk-for-immudb","depth":2,"text":"Where to find the official Java SDK for immudb"},{"id":"immudb4j-introduction","depth":2,"text":"immudb4j Introduction"},{"id":"installation","depth":2,"text":"Installation"},{"id":"supported-versions","depth":2,"text":"Supported Versions"},{"id":"quickstart","depth":2,"text":"Quickstart"},{"id":"step-by-step-guide","depth":2,"text":"Step by step guide"},{"id":"creating-a-client","depth":3,"text":"Creating a Client"},{"id":"user-sessions","depth":3,"text":"User sessions"},{"id":"creating-a-database","depth":3,"text":"Creating a database"},{"id":"setting-the-active-database","depth":3,"text":"Setting the active database"},{"id":"traditional-read-and-write","depth":3,"text":"Traditional read and write"},{"id":"verified-or-safe-read-and-write","depth":3,"text":"Verified or Safe read and write"},{"id":"closing-the-client","depth":3,"text":"Closing the client"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"immudb"}]},{"type":"text","value":" is "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"lightweight, high-speed immutable database"}]},{"type":"text","value":" for systems and applications. immudb is open source under the "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/blob/master/LICENSE","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Apache v2.0 License"}]},{"type":"text","value":"."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"With "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://github.com/codenotary/immudb","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"immudb"}]},{"type":"text","value":" you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes indelibly in a tamperproof database. immudb makes sure that not just the latest data, but the complete history of, say, your debit/credit transactions is stored unchangeable."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"setup-immudb"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#setup-immudb","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Setup immudb"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you haven't setup immudb yet, this is the time to do so.

You only need to start immudb either as a process, a service or a docker container.\n\nIt's up to you if you want to build the Docker /images/blog yourself based on the Dockerfiles in the GitHub repository or use the prebuild ones on Dockerhub.\n\nimmudb is using the following defaults:\n\n- Auth user: immudb\n- Auth password: immudb\n- Service Port: 3322 (immudb)\n- Metrics Port: 9497 (Prometheus exporter)\n\n### immudb **Dockerhub**\n\ndocker run -it -d -p 3322:3322 -p 9497:9497 — name immudb codenotary/immudb:latest\n\n### standalone Binaries\n\nEach release provides all binaries for different operating systems. you can find these here: [immudb releases](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases)\n\nIf you want to build the \\*\\*binaries \\*\\*yourself, simply [clone this repo](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb) and run one of the following commands based on your operating system.\n\n```shell\n# Linux\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 make immudb-static\n# macOS\nGOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 make immudb-static\n# Microsoft Windows\nGOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 make immudb-static\n```\n\nThen you can run immudb\n\n```shell\n# run immudb in the foreground \n./immudb\n# run immudb in the background \n./immudb -d\n```\n\n### install immudb as a service\n\n```shell\n# install immudb service \n./immudb service install\n\\# check current immudb service status \n./immudb service status\n\\# stop immudb service \n./immudb service stop\n\\# start immudb service \n./immudb service start\n```\n\n## Where to find the official Java SDK for immudb\n\nThe always up2date Java SDK for immudb can be find as [immudb4j on Github](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j)\n\n## immudb4j Introduction\n\nimmudb4j implements a [grpc](https://grpc.io/) immudb client. A minimalist API is exposed for applications while cryptographic verifications and state update protocol implementation are fully implemented by this client. Latest validated immudb state may be keep in the local filesystem when using default `FileRootHolder`, please read [immudb research paper](https://immudb.io/) for details of how immutability is ensured by [immudb](https://immudb.io/).\n\n## Installation\n\nJust include immudb4j as a dependency in your project:\n\nif using `Maven`:\n\n    <dependency\\>\n        <groupId\\>io.codenotary</groupId\\>\n        <artifactId\\>immudb4j</artifactId\\>\n        <version\\>0.1.6</version\\>\n    </dependency\\>\n\nif using `Gradle`:\n\n    compile 'io.codenotary:immudb4j:0.1.6'\n\nNote: immudb4j is currently hosted in [Github Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages).\n\nThus `immudb4j Github Package repository` needs to be included with authentication. When using maven it means to include immudb4j Github Package in your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file. See \"Configuring Apache Maven for use with GitHub Packages\" and \"Configuring Gradle for use with GitHub Packages\" at [Github Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages).\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nimmudb4j supports the [latest immudb release](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases/tag/v0.7.1).\n\n## Quickstart\n\n[Hello Immutable World!](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-client-examples/tree/master/java) example can be found in `immudb-client-examples` repo.\n\nFollow its `README` to build and run it.\n\n## Step by step guide\n\n### Creating a Client\n\nThe following code snippets shows how to create a client.\n\nUsing default configuration:\n\n    ImmuClient immuClient = ImmuClient.newBuilder().build();\n\nSetting `immudb` url and port:\n\n    ImmuClient immuClient = ImmuClient.newBuilder()\n                                .setServerUrl(\"localhost\")\n                                .setServerPort(3322)\n                                .build();\n\nCustomizing the `Root Holder`:\n\n    FileRootHolder rootHolder = FileRootHolder.newBuilder()\n                                    .setRootsFolder(\"./my_immuapp_roots\")\n                                    .build();\n\n    ImmuClient immuClient = ImmuClient.newBuilder()\n                                      .withRootHolder(rootHolder)\n                                      .build();\n\n### User sessions\n\nUse `login` and `logout` methods to initiate and terminate user sessions:\n\n    immuClient.login(\"usr1\", \"pwd1\");\n\n    // Interact with immudb using logged user\n\n    immuClient.logout();\n\n### Creating a database\n\nCreating a new database is quite simple:\n\n    immuClient.createDatabase(\"db1\");\n\n### Setting the active database\n\nSpecify the active database with:\n\n    immuClient.useDatabase(\"db1\");\n\n### Traditional read and write\n\nimmudb provides read and write operations that behave as a traditional key-value store i.e. no cryptographic verification is done. This operation may be used when validations can be postponed:\n\n    client.set(\"k123\", new byte[]{1, 2, 3});\n    \n    byte[] v = client.get(\"k123\");\n\n### Verified or Safe read and write\n\nimmudb provides built-in cryptographic verification for any entry. The client implements the mathematical validations while the application uses as a traditional read or write operation:\n\n    try {\n        client.safeSet(\"k123\", new byte[]{1, 2, 3});\n    \n        byte[] v \\= client.safeGet(\"k123\");\n\n    } (catch VerificationException e) {\n\n        //TODO: tampering detected!\n\n    }\n\n### Closing the client\n\nTo programmatically close the connection with immudb server use the `shutdown` operation:\n\n    immuClient.shutdown();\n\nNote: after shutdown, a new client needs to be created to establish a new connection.\n\nThere are easier options for non-developers (like immuclient) and also SDK driver for .net, Java, Node.js, Python available.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/immudb4j-get-started","extension":".md","slug":"immudb4j-get-started","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.738Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624469},"$loki":38},{"title":"Immutably store or guarantee the immutability of documents and invoices for compliance reasons","date":"2020-08-12","image":"/images/blog/bookkeeper.jpg","tags":["GoBD","immutability","compliance"],"toc":[{"id":"immutability","depth":2,"text":"Immutability"},{"id":"tracking-of-changes","depth":2,"text":"Tracking of changes"},{"id":"existing-applications","depth":2,"text":"Existing applications"},{"id":"the-data-structure-base","depth":2,"text":"The data structure (base)"},{"id":"introducing-immudb","depth":2,"text":"Introducing immudb"},{"id":"implementing-immudb","depth":2,"text":"Implementing immudb"},{"id":"alternative-1-valuedocument-checksum","depth":3,"text":"Alternative 1: Value=document checksum"},{"id":"alternative-2-keydocument-checksum","depth":3,"text":"Alternative 2: Key=document checksum"},{"id":"alternative-3-full-storage","depth":3,"text":"Alternative 3: Full storage"},{"id":"summary","depth":2,"text":"Summary"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In most countries, invoices, contracts and important documents relating to the operation and running of businesses must be stored in a forgery-proof manner."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Taking Germany as an example, the GoBD sets the principles of lawful computer-aided accounting."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Some detail:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"GoBD"}]},{"type":"text","value":" are the Principles for properly maintaining, keeping and storing books, records and documents in electronic form and for data access, as provided by the German tax authorities.

Put simply, the _GoBD_ deals with how to store information electronically and how to handle tax-relevant documents. The documentation requirements, as well as the control and the use of appropriate IT are regulated in this context. The GoBD also regulates the access of auditors and the scope of the guidelines. Compliance with accounting processes and logging are also addressed.\n\nThe main principles are categorized into:\n\n1. Transparency\n2. Immutability and tracking of changes\n3. Neatness\n4. Completeness\n5. Timely bookings\n6. Accuracy\n\nWhile all are important, the focus of this blog post is **immutability and tracking of changes**.\n\n## [](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb.io/blob/master/src/_blog/2020-08-12-immudb-invoice-immutable-storage.md#immutability)Immutability\n\nThe criterion of immutability requires an identification of the changes made to tax-relevant data. The registration is thus absolutely necessary for the bookkeeping. This refers to whether the bookkeeping has taken place at regular intervals. If this is not the case, there is a formal deficiency in the bookkeeping system. Therefore, the commit time must be recorded in each case.\n\nA booking record is considered unchangeable only through the final commit. Any control or authorization by other persons in the company remains unaffected, especially in the case of batch or preliminary entry.\n\nThe immutability is thus valid irrespective of whether it is an electronically supported record or a document in paper form. The records with document characteristics and the land registers (inward and outward registers) only have to be provided with a time. Furthermore, the auditor may request activity logs. This also applies to changes to the master data or in the software. For example, office formats often do not meet these requirements.\n\n## [](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb.io/blob/master/src/_blog/2020-08-12-immudb-invoice-immutable-storage.md#tracking-of-changes)Tracking of changes\n\nSubsequent changes are to be made exclusively in such a way that both the original content and the fact that changes have been made remain recognizable. In the case of program-generated or program-controlled recordings (automated documents or recurring documents), changes to the generation, and control data on which the recording is based shall also be recorded.\n\nThis applies in particular to the recording of changes in settings or the parameterization of the software. If master data (for example, abbreviation or key directories, organizational charts) is changed, the unique meaning in the corresponding transaction data (for example, sales tax key, currency unit, account characteristic) must be retained.\n\nIf necessary, master data changes must be excluded or master data with validity specifications that must be historized to prevent ambiguous links. It must also not be possible to subsequently change a \"change history\".\n\n## [](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb.io/blob/master/src/_blog/2020-08-12-immudb-invoice-immutable-storage.md#existing-applications)Existing applications\n\nThere are countless ways how accounting, bookkeeping and document management is done in different companies, therefore a new technology or solution should ideally work in combination with the existing systems (without or with minimal changes).\n\nThe beauty of immudb is, that it can easily be used either as a document storage or simply as an immutable ledger that tracks the unique document identity and its updates or changes.\n\n## [](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb.io/blob/master/src/_blog/2020-08-12-immudb-invoice-immutable-storage.md#the-data-structure-base)The data structure (base)\n\nLet's assume your software is either storing all invoices and other documents in a file system or a database (PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, ...) and tracks also changes (cancellation, reimbursement aso.).\n\nEvery document including invoices, has a unique checksum ([SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)) based on the file content. Every tiny change to that file will result in a new checksum. That way every document can be securely identified.\n\nWhen databases are used to store the data you need to keep in mind that only the last value is saved and the former value overwritten. It's up to the software or user to keep track of the changes. Anyone that gains access to the database can change these records without leaving traces.\n\nUsing immudb that gets solved automatically, as value changes are never deleted and the full history will be maintained in a tamper-proof way.\n\nMany software products allow to consume events using scripts or software. That feature can be used to update information in immudb while remaining the full change history.\n\n## [](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb.io/blob/master/src/_blog/2020-08-12-immudb-invoice-immutable-storage.md#introducing-immudb)Introducing immudb\n\nimmudb is a lightweight yet highly scalable immutable database. Providing low-latency and high-throughput comparable to a raw key-value store but ensuring any tampering is not only properly identified but scoped.\n\nA well-defined update protocol between clients and server provides an on-demand tampering detection while built-in corruption and consistency checkers give rise to the first-ever proactive tampering awareness database.\n\nimmudb security is not about role-based access, it's not about being an open-source project, it's about the mathematical algorithms and state update protocol it employs. Whenever immudb is able to provide satisfactory proof against the returned data, it means data is the origin and was not tampered by any means.\n\nInternally, immudb stores data together with a hash data-structure used to generate cryptographic proofs. The additional data structure that is generated can be thought of as a mutable merkle-tree and an update protocol run by clients and server is always made against the current state of immudb.\n\nWhile immudb shares some technical similarities with blockchain platforms, immudb is not meant to provide smart- contracts or de-centralized governance capabilities. But it provides fully-automated tools to accomplish enterprise-grade immutability, ensuring any tampering on sensitive data is not only detected but scoped.\n\nImmutability is ensured by following a well-defined update protocol. Clients and auditors continuously evaluate the state update provided by the server. Such evaluation is based on cryptographic proofs, meaning validation is mathematically determined, making it impossible to fake or circumvent, resulting in any tampering being immediately detected.\n\n## [](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb.io/blob/master/src/_blog/2020-08-12-immudb-invoice-immutable-storage.md#implementing-immudb)Implementing immudb\n\nThere are 3 different ways our users shared with us, how they make sure that all documents are stored immutably and tamper-proof.\n\nKeep in mind that immudb is currently a key-value store and not a relational database.

This blog will walk you through the process of integrating blockchain-based code signing into your application using Golang.\n\nFor more on verifying with Golang, see our previous blog **[here](https://www.codenotary.io/verify-digital-asset-integrity-against-the-blockchain-for-free-using-golang/)**.\n\n### **Signing Assets**\n\nIn order to have your application verify the assets you want to use, those assets will need to be signed and have their signatures stored on the blockchain. This way they can they can be referenced globally regardless of hosting service or storage location. However, before you can start signing assets, there are a few things you need to have in place.\n\n### **Prerequisites**\n\nFirst, you will need to create your CodeNotary account, which you can do **[here](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=integrating-blockchain-based-code-signing-into-your-application-using-golang)** and see a video on how to do **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrlygvXF1XE)**. Once you have an account set up, you will have the ability to start signing assets with the CodeNotary `vcn` CLI tool. The next step is then to prepare your `vcn` configuration, which you can do simply by running `vcn login`. The first time the command is executed, a `$HOME/.vcn` folder will be created with the configuration and generate a user key for you. For more details, check out our GitHub user guide on configuration **[here](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/blob/master/docs/user-guide/configuration.md)**. Also, you’ll want to be sure that the `$HOME~/.vcn` folder is accessible by the program you are coding.\n\n \n\n### **Using Asset Signing in Your Go Code**\n\nWe created `vcn` to be able to be utilized directly from within an individual application’s code structure. Extracting and placing a global verification checker like `vcn` directly into your project gives you the ability to configure it to run whenever you need or want it to do so.\n\n \n\nTo include asset signing in your code, use the snippet below:\n\n \n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n \"fmt\"\n \n [github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/api](http://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/api)\"\n [github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/meta](http://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/meta)\"\n [github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/store](http://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/store)\"\n)\n\nfunc init() {\n // Set ~/.vcn directory\n if err := store.SetDefaultDir(); err != nil {\n panic(err)  \n // Load the configuration\n if err := store.LoadConfig(); err != nil {\n panic(err) \n}\n\n// currentUser returns the current authenticated vcn user, if any, \notherwise an error is returned\nfunc currentUser() (\\*api.User, error) {\n email := store.Config().CurrentContext\n if email == \"\" {\n return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"no user has been set for current context\")\n}\n    u := api.NewUser(email)\n return u, nil\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n passphrase := \"<passphrase here>\"\n // Get the current user\n user, err := currentUser()\n if err != nil {\n panic(err) \n  // Create a fake asset\n asset := api.Artifact{\n Name: \"<asset name here>\",\n Hash: \"<my hash here>\",\n Size: 11, // a size > 0 is required \n  verification, err := user.Sign(\n asset,\n user.DefaultKey(), // get and use the default key, optionally another key can be used\n passphrase,\n meta.StatusTrusted,     // other status (meta.StatusUntrusted, meta.StatusUnsupported) can be used too\n meta.VisibilityPrivate, // or meta.VisibilityPublic \n if err != nil {\n panic(err) \n}\n  fmt.Println(\"Asset has been successfully signed with Status: \", meta.StatusName(verification.Status))\n}\n\n \n\n### **How It Works**\n\n \n\n![](/images/blog/0*UgN2KIlx0_2gNqSC.png)\n\n \n\nThe `github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/api` package gives you access to all the low-level functions.\n\n \n\nThe `github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/storepackage` pulls in the `vcn` API and allows you to write directly to the blockchain.\n\n \n\nThe `store.SetDefaultDir` then sets your default directory for where you will store your asset signatures locally. Then the `store.LoadConfig` will set up the configuration locally and enable you to write to the blockchain.\n\n \n\n![](/images/blog/0*rDVD9-d9kkdm8Kk3.png)\n\n \n\nNext, you will need to create the function `currentUser` to validate the current `vcn` user exists in the system. If the information entered is correct, then the user is allowed to proceed, otherwise, an error is returned.\n\n \n\n![](/images/blog/0*p2HtUqRlI54_3Rj0.png)\n\n \n\nAfter setting up a path to check your user information is stored within the system, you need to create a function for allowing you to enter your passphrase, which will enable you to sign assets and have their hashes written to the blockchain. The `vcn` application will then match the previously entered `currentUser` to the entered passphrase. If successful, the system will allow you to proceed. If not, an error will be returned.\n\n \n\nThe next step is to choose an asset you want to load for signing later. (You can also create a fake asset if you are just testing out the functionality.) But first, you need to set up output fields for correctly storing the name, hash, and size of a newly signed asset for the `api.Artifact` function to slot created data into.\n\n \n\nYou can read more about all the fields in our Go doc at [https://godoc.org/github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/api#Artifact.](https://godoc.org/github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/api#Artifact.)\n\n \n\n![](/images/blog/0*ts5UUJn7fO4w6oNi.png)\n\n \n\nOnce your fields have been set up to store your signing artifacts, you need to get the key the system generated for you the first time you signed in using `vcn login` and which is stored, by default, in the `~/.vcn` folder. (Optionally, you can choose to use another key for signing if you wish, though you will have to designate it specifically.) After you have told the system which key to use in the signing process, you need to specify the passphrase that will allow your key to be used to sign an asset.\n\n \n\nIf everything is successful, the system will append the designated `meta.Status` and `meta.Visibility` to your signature. The output you should see is the printed line as seen in the example below:\n\n \n\n`Asset has been successfully signed with Status: TRUSTED`\n\n \n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nInserting the ability for your application to sign the digital assets you create or use allows you to benefit from the immutability of the blockchain and rest assured your code, components, applications, and more are just as safe as the way you left them.\n\n \n\nInformation on our entire `vcn` project can be found in our GitHub repository, which you can check out by following the link below.\n\n \n\n \n\n**[Take Me to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vchain-us)**\n\nor\n\n**[Learn More at CodeNotary.io](https://www.codenotary.io/)**\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/integrating-blockchain-based-code-signing-into-your-application-using-golang","extension":".md","slug":"integrating-blockchain-based-code-signing-into-your-application-using-golang","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624513},"$loki":40},{"title":"Jenkins Build Deployment Pipeline: A How To for Ensuring Integrity","image":"/images/blog/Jenkins-Automation.2-300x96.png","date":"2019-04-24","toc":[{"id":"the-weak-link-in-devops-pipelines","depth":2,"text":"The Weak Link in DevOps Pipelines"},{"id":"securing-devops-builds-with-codenotary","depth":2,"text":"Securing DevOps Builds with CodeNotary"},{"id":"integrating-vchain-codenotary-into-jenkins-build-deployment-pipeline","depth":2,"text":"Integrating vChain CodeNotary into Jenkins Build Deployment Pipeline"},{"id":"steps","depth":2,"text":"Steps"},{"id":"step-1-system-level-configuration","depth":3,"text":"Step 1: System-level configuration"},{"id":"step-2-per-build-job","depth":3,"text":"Step 2: Per build job"},{"id":"step-3-before-deployment","depth":3,"text":"Step 3: Before deployment"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Jenkins Automation.2","src":"/images/blog/Jenkins-Automation.2-300x96.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In this blog, we will briefly touch on the importance of DevOps having strong security, current hole in DevOps security aka DevSecOps, Jenkins Automation’s role in the build process, and with a technical walkthrough on how to integrate the vChain CodeNotary tool with your Jenkins build deployment pipeline to ensure its integrity."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"the-weak-link-in-devops-pipelines"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#the-weak-link-in-devops-pipelines","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"The Weak Link in DevOps Pipelines"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"DevOps has been widely adopted for many years for its benefits including speeding up the software development process.

However, in the CICD process, there is one significant weak link when it comes to ensuring the integrity of code from development to production. That is, when the build is created, stored on a repository and then picked up to be deployed into production, no-one knows if it has been maliciously edited. No integrity check was performed on the containers, scripts, clusters, or any of the other build components. It is completely possible that someone could have tampered with the build code and injected it with malware. Unfortunately, if the code’s integrity was never verified, there is no way to be completely sure what you are deploying is what you built. (And that is before we even get to the problems from after code has been discovered to be compromised as we posted about **[here](https://www.codenotary.io/the-failure-of-the-certificate-revocation-list-crl/)**.)\n\n \n\n## Securing DevOps Builds with CodeNotary\n\nWith CodeNotary, the solution is an **easy, single step** where you can be 100% sure your code is exactly how you left it. **Code integrity is no longer a question** with today’s technology. It is now possible to **verify** the **integrity** of all of your code **at every stage of the build process** before you ever deploy anything into production.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, one of the best things with CodeNotary’s **robust, multi-layered, security solution** is its seamless integration prevents problems from arising and scaling in size later on down the pipeline, creating **significant savings** in terms of potential patch costs and other associated damages.\n\n \n\nBy integrating CodeNotary’s **distributed ledger technology** into your DevOps and Jenkins builds, you now have the ability to keep a **30,000-foot view** of all shipped components sent to any customer **that scopes down to an infinitely granular level**.\n\n \n\nHere’s how simple it is to setup Jenkins code build notarization.\n\n \n\n## **Integrating vChain CodeNotary into Jenkins Build Deployment Pipeline**\n\nIn order to maintain an optimal DevSecOps pipeline with your CI/CD build, we have developed an application that can verify the integrity of all your code continuously. The details of how to configure CodeNotary to automatically sign Jenkins' builds is below. The integration has 3 main steps in what otherwise can be labeled a 10 step process. The 3 main steps are:\n\n \n\n## **Steps**\n\n1. Configuration System level\n    1. Configure vcn credentials system-wide in Jenkins\n2. Per build job\n    1. Tie vcn credentials in from system configuration to local environment variables\n    2. Sign asset\n3. Before deployment\n    1. Run vcn verify with asset parameters\n\n### **Step 1: System-level configuration**\n\nOn the Home Screen, locate and click the Credentials link in the sidebar menu to expand the submenu beneath it.\n\n \n\n![001 Home Screen](/images/blog/001-Home-Screen-174x300.png)\n\n#### **Step 1.1**\n\nWith the submenu opened up, go ahead and select the credentials type, in this case, select System.\n\n \n\n![001a Select Credentials - Jenkins Automation](/images/blog/001a-Select-Credentials-159x300.png)\n\n#### **Step 1.2**\n\nAfter selecting System, click Add Domain and notice the right-hand display shows ‘Global credentials (unrestricted)’. Click the link.\n\n \n\n![001b System Credentials - Jenkins Automation](/images/blog/001b-System-Credentials-300x91.png)\n\n \n\n#### **Step 1.3**\n\nCreate new credentials by selecting the Add Credentials option.\n\n![001c Create Credentials - Jenkins Automation](/images/blog/001c-Create-Credentials-300x136.png)\n\n### **Step 2: Per build job**\n\nNow that you have the credential creation display opened, you will need to create your credential entries for your vcn keystore password, vcn user account, and vcn password.\n\n \n\n![002 Create Credential Entries - Jenkins Automation](/images/blog/002-Create-Credential-Entries-300x48.png)\n\n \n\nOnce you have all 3, your list of credentials should look something similar to the below.\n\n \n\n![003 List Credentials - Jenkins Automation](/images/blog/003-List-Credentials-300x20.png)\n\n#### **Step 2.1**\n\nNext, you will need to configure the build job environment for each build job you have. This is relatively simple. All you need to do is to tie the vcn credentials in from the system configuration to the local environment variables by setting the appropriate bindings.\n\n \n\n![004 Configure Build Job Environment - Jenkins Automation](/images/blog/004-Configure-Build-Job-Environment-300x147.png)\n\n \n\nAfter successfully setting your bindings, you will need to add a build job build step for signing your code with the vcn application.

Nathan works in the finance industry though he asked us not to name his company at this time. It was great to hear such positive feedback and means a lot to us. Giving CodeNotary users the utmost confidence in their digital assets and is exactly what we set out to do from day one. Below is our conversation with Nathan.\n\n \n\n\\--\n\n \n\n**CodeNotary:** How did you first hear about CodeNotary?\n\n \n\n**Nathan Nguyen:** I came across you guys for the first time recently in a HackerNoon article, “**[The Day We Started to Protect DevOps with Blockchain](https://hackernoon.com/the-day-we-started-to-protect-devops-with-blockchain-a9g6y33gt)**”. \n\n \n\nI’ve always had a fascination for blockchain and its real-world applications, especially beyond its currency like usages. And I hadn’t heard of any other blockchain apps specifically for DevOps. So it piqued my curiosity.\n\n \n\n**CN:** What attracted you to wanting to try out CodeNotary for yourself?\n\n \n\n**NN:** Well it was a couple of things. I’ve been in DevOps for a while and am always trying to keep an eye out for what could raise my level of knowledge, make my job easier, or even something that might be beneficial to my manager or the team. And since lately my company has been really gearing up for Cyber-Security month, doing a lot of internal awareness-raising, encouraging us to start thinking more about security when we’re building out, etc., it was all a kind of perfect storm I guess you could say. \n\n \n\n**CN:** How was the initial setup for you?\n\n \n\n**NN:** Downloading it and setting it up was pretty easy and straightforward following the how to get started video you have on **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrlygvXF1XE)**. I was up and running in probably about 15 minutes but that was more because I looking around a lot.\n\n \n\n**CN:** What was it like notarizing your first asset? Did you have any expectations? \n\n \n\n**NN:** Sort of but not really. I was more holding off on forming an opinion until I had gone through the \\[notarization and authentication\\] process entirely. \n\n \n\n**CN:** After going through both sides of the process, did you have a better idea of how you could use CodeNotary?\n\n \n\n**NN:** Yes, very much so. After authenticating my first container, I really started realizing what it could do. I like not having to worry about unknown code getting inserted into my files, /images/blog, git commits, etc. The fact that the authentication is decentralized against the blockchain, and not just \\[the company’s\\] or 3rd party’s database is great. I know a lot of devs who don’t care about that stuff and just want to get their code to prod, but I like knowing what I push is clean and that I’m not helping to propagate anything malicious. Plus, since the app can be automated, it basically means that after the initial setup I don’t have to worry about it. So I get more time to build, which I’d rather be doing anyway. \n\n \n\n**CN:** That’s great! Have you shared it with anyone else in your company?\n\n \n\n**NN:** Shared it with my manager.\n\n \n\n**CN:** What did he say?\n\n \n\n**NN:** He appreciated me mentioning it. I’m new at the company so I don’t think he expected that from me. He said it sounded pretty interesting and discovered the multi-notarization and itemized revocation features, which he really liked and thought would be useful for our cross-team workflows. \n\n \n\n**CN:** Have you heard back from him yet?\n\n \n\n**NN:** Not yet, but will let you know as soon as I do.\n\n \n\n**CN:** Please do. Is there anything else you think we should know about or would like to add?\n\n \n\n**NN:** No. Not really. I like what you guys built. It makes my day easier and it’s applying blockchain to DevOps. That’s pretty cool. \n\n \n\n\\--\n\n \n\nIt’s great to know CodeNotary is being so well regarded. We love hearing stories from our users like Nathan.

Directly affected by chosen-prefix collisions are:\n\n- PGP keys can be forged if third parties generate SHA-1 key certifications\n- X.509 certificates could be broken if some Certificate Authorities issue SHA-1 certificates with predictable serial numbers\n\nPlease note that classical collisions and chosen-prefix collisions do not threaten all usages of SHA-1. In particular, HMAC-SHA-1 seems relatively safe, and preimage resistance (aka ability to invert the hash function) of SHA-1 remains unbroken as of today. Yet, cryptographers recommend to deprecate SHA-1 everywhere, even when there is no direct evidence that this weaknesses can be exploited.\n\n## What to do?\n\nRemove any use of SHA-1 in your product as soon as possible and use instead **SHA-256** or **SHA-3**.\n\nThat can also be done quite simple and even more comprehensive by using CodeNotary.io functionality. CodeNotary digital identities use SHA-256 and are stored tamperproof with additional attributes.\n\n[Tamperproof SHA-256 digital identities](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/pgp-keys-digital-security-for-documents-and-software-and-much-more-threatened-by-existing-sha-1-exploits","extension":".md","slug":"pgp-keys-digital-security-for-documents-and-software-and-much-more-threatened-by-existing-sha-1-exploits","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624584},"$loki":45},{"title":"PowerShell File Trust without digital certificates","image":"/images/blog/env-1024x619.png","date":"2019-10-28","toc":[{"id":"powershell-file-trust-watchdog","depth":2,"text":"PowerShell File Trust Watchdog"},{"id":"preparation","depth":2,"text":"Preparation"},{"id":"watch-a-single-directory","depth":3,"text":"Watch a single directory"},{"id":"workflow-environment-based-on-folder-structure","depth":3,"text":"Workflow environment based on folder structure"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"CodeNotary allows to trust, untrust or unsupport any file, script or document on your system.

Canonical confirmed that there is no indication of data alteration or deletion, though it is still investigating. Despite numerous previous attacks, GitHub and its user accounts continue to remain vulnerable. This blog discusses the recent Canonical incident, previous GitHub incidents, and how one company is intelligently responding to the shifting security landscape by utilizing blockchain to protect against potential security breach fallout. \n\n \n\n## **What Happened**\n\nOver the Fourth of July weekend, a hacker gained access to Canonical’s GitHub account. Acting blatantly obvious, they created 10 repos in Canonical’s account with the naming convention CAN\\_GOT\\_HAXXD\\_# as seen below:\n\n \n\n![GitHub Attack - Canonical Repo](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-07-12-10.26.39-300x292.png)\n\n \n\nUbuntu Security immediately launched an investigation to get their arms around the full extent of the breach as well as removed the compromised account. They also disconnected Launchpad infrastructure, where the Ubuntu distribution is built and maintained, from their organization and are implementing remediations as necessary. \n\n \n\nUbuntu Security confirmed in a statement that there was no indication any source code or PII (Personally Identifiable Information) was impacted.\n\n![Ubuntu Security Tweet - Canonical Hack](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-07-12-10.47.40-294x300.png)\n\n \n\nAt the end of their investigation, the security team will publish a publicly available update of the Linux distribution. \n\n \n\n## **The Regular Occurrence of GitHub Attacks**\n\nAttacks have become a regular occurrence for GitHub. Perhaps, this most recent attack was actually a white hat test in response to the regular attacks, though this remains to be seen. \n\n \n\nThat said, last month, the official Ubuntu forum was hacked were approximately 2 million usernames and passwords were stolen. Then in May 2019, hackers were breaking into private code repos on GitHub, copying their data locally, deleting the data on the repo, and ransoming the copies to the project owners. And in June 2018, the Gentoo Linux distributor was hacked by an attacker who gained access due to a weak password and was able to maliciously inject a backdoor into some GitHub downloads for a specific OS version. \n\n \n\nMaintaining operational excellence is a big deal. In the security industry, the understanding of account compromise has veered away from a hope that it doesn’t happen to an understanding that it does happen and to everyone. As such, trust has shifted from an implicit assumption to a process of explicit verification.\n\n \n\n## **Protecting File Integrity from the Effects of Compromise**\n\nEverything can be hacked, so protection is key. Here is what one company, Virtuozzo, is doing to protect against hacks like the GitHub example. Virtuozzo (https://www.virtuozzo.com), a hyper-converged infrastructure software vendor, is utilizing CodeNotary (see the next section for more information about CodeNotary) to incorporate the powerful security mechanisms of blockchain into their offerings. This way no matter what security leak might be exploited, the source code is immutable and protected due to the blockchain-based service.\n\n \n\nThe way it works is that each file stored by Virtuozzo has it’s fingerprint (aka its hash) taken and then stored immutably on the CodeNotary’s blockchain. Then from that point on, every file can be verified as 100% authentic and untampered at any point in time, from anywhere in the world. By doing so, Virtuozzo gives its customers peace of mind anytime they open and use any Virtuozzo stored file as it is protected by the immutable CodeNotary blockchain.\n\n \n\n## **About CodeNotary**\n\nCodeNotary brings trust and integrity to DevOps and the software industry. It allows development teams to strongly identify and track their digital assets and artifacts, such as libraries, builds, source code, containers, and dependencies throughout the DevOps process. This way organizations can always guarantee the veracity and integrity of their digital assets to themselves as a team and to others outside the team. By using digital ledger technology, it creates an immutable chain of trust which for the first time enables zero trust to be infused into application development and operation.\n\n \n\nTest out CodeNotary for free and see for yourself.\n\n \n\n \n\n**[Start Your Free Trial](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)**\n\n \n\n \n\n**REFERENCES:**\n\n[https://www.linuxtoday.com/security/canonical-github-account-hacked-ubuntu-source-code-safe.html](https://www.linuxtoday.com/security/canonical-github-account-hacked-ubuntu-source-code-safe.html)\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20190706144600/github.com/canonicalltd](https://web.archive.org/web/20190706144600/github.com/canonicalltd)\n\n[https://www.vice.com/en\\_us/article/vb9v33/github-bitbucket-repositories-ransomware](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb9v33/github-bitbucket-repositories-ransomware)\n\n[http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/ubuntu-forums-hacked-here-is-what-hacker-stole](http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/ubuntu-forums-hacked-here-is-what-hacker-stole)\n\n[https://www.securityweek.com/canonical-github-account-hijacked](https://www.securityweek.com/canonical-github-account-hijacked)\n\n[https://www.securityweek.com/gentoo-publishes-incident-report-after-github-hack](https://www.securityweek.com/gentoo-publishes-incident-report-after-github-hack)\n\n[https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Infrastructure/Incident\\_Reports/2018-06-28\\_Github](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Infrastructure/Incident_Reports/2018-06-28_Github)\n\n[https://twitter.com/ubuntu\\_sec/status/1147675201632473088](https://twitter.com/ubuntu_sec/status/1147675201632473088)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/protect-yourself-with-blockchain-from-canonical-like-github-attacks","extension":".md","slug":"protect-yourself-with-blockchain-from-canonical-like-github-attacks","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624616},"$loki":47},{"title":"Protecting Against $120mm Invoice Scam Loss Using Blockchain","image":"/images/blog/Invoice-Authentication-v4-300x232.png","date":"2019-07-17","toc":[{"id":"how-the-scam-works","depth":2,"text":"How the Scam Works"},{"id":"the-inevitability-of-the-click","depth":3,"text":"The Inevitability of the Click"},{"id":"recon-for-increasing-scam-success","depth":3,"text":"Recon for Increasing Scam Success"},{"id":"effects-of-the-scam","depth":2,"text":"Effects of the Scam"},{"id":"removing-the-hacker-incentive-for-invoice-scams","depth":2,"text":"Removing the Hacker Incentive for Invoice Scams"},{"id":"using-blockchain-to-protect-against-invoice-scams","depth":2,"text":"Using Blockchain to Protect Against Invoice Scams"},{"id":"how-codenotary-works","depth":2,"text":"How CodeNotary Works"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Invoice Authentication by CodeNotary","src":"/images/blog/Invoice-Authentication-v4-300x232.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"$120 million, that was the price tag for Google and Facebook.

Over the last few years, a hacker named Evaldas Rimasauskas scammed the two corporate giants out of significant amount of cash with an attack known as business email compromise aka invoice fraud. Rimasauskas has since been caught and was recently sentenced for his crimes. However, the attack remains very common. So much, in fact, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center warned companies last year that these types of attacks are becoming more and more prevalent. Organizations of all sizes, SMB’s to multinationals, are being targeted and falling victim to the scheme. This blog discusses how the scam works, the effects it can bring, and how to use blockchain to protect corporate and customer interests.\n\n \n\n## **How the Scam Works**\n\nThe scam is a phased attack where the attacker’s basic steps are:\n\n \n\n1. **Phishing**: Gain access to a corporation’s digital environment with a phishing email campaign.\n2. **Recon**: Conduct reconnaissance to get a feel for the real operations of the business.\n3. **Plant Fake Documents**: Create a fake invoice (and optionally any other fake collateral to support it) that mimics a real partner/contractor account. Then insert it into the organization’s normal business flow.\n4. **Collect Your Money**: Have the invoice amount sent to a personally controlled bank account.\n5. **Rinse and Repeat**: If the scam went undetected, the attacker just might send another one to the same victim? (It’s not uncommon.)\n\n \n\n### **The Inevitability of the Click**\n\nYears ago in a Data Breach Investigation Report, Verizon discussed what they termed ‘The Inevitability of the Click’. The term is still just as relevant today. Essentially, the concept refers to low effort it takes to run a successful phishing campaign. Given enough emails, someone is going to click on a link or attachment and unknowingly let an attacker blow right past their (state of the art) security perimeter. (Social engineering is a lot harder to combat.) From the statistics Verizon collected, in order to get a 50% probability of someone clicking, an attacker only needed to send a surprisingly low amount of 3 emails. For a nearly guaranteed click, an attacker only needed to send 10 emails. Thus it is that attackers are bound to have someone open the door for them and let them waltz right into your _secure_ environment.\n\n \n\n### **Recon for Increasing Scam Success**\n\nOnce inside, the hacker starts to observe the regular practices of the business. He does this in order to get a feel for how to best stay under the radar of the company while executing his invoice scam. After, the attacker has a pretty good idea of what kind of details (name, address, services provided, the normal charge for those services, etc.) to include, he will create an official-looking invoice to be planted into regular business operations. The invoice is then sent to the appropriate person within the business organization generally from a spoofed or hacked email of a real service provider or employee. \n\n \n\nOften times, because the invoice is so convincing, funds are transferred to the attacker’s offshore bank account before the business becomes wise to the scheme. Even worse, fraudsters have also been known to go as far as creating fake letters, contracts, and more to substantiate their sham invoice. Sometimes attackers are so well disguised, as in the case with Facebook and Google, they simply keep the scam running and continue bilking the company for significant sums of money. \n\n \n\n## **Effects of the Scam**\n\nAs mentioned, invoice scams can have large price tags for victims. Unfortunately for them, their banks don’t help to make them whole in such cases. The negative financial impact can cause businesses to suffer hardship or even lead them to declare bankruptcy. Such was the case with the denim company, Diesel Jeans. In short, unless better protective measures are taken, businesses and their stakeholders will remain at risk.\n\n \n\n## **Removing the Hacker Incentive for Invoice Scams**\n\nEmail accounts may or may not continue to be so incredibly vulnerable. It remains to be seen. That said, the prize for an attacker is not in the compromised email itself, but in the ability to insert fake documents into a target’s business operations for the hopeful payday it brings. However, make fake invoices an impossibility by making counterfeit documents instantly identifiable, then the scam can no longer work. When that happens, corporations will be able to save themselves from becoming a victim of invoice scams and from the huge losses that ensue. \n\n \n\n## **Using Blockchain to Protect Against Invoice Scams**\n\nCodeNotary is able to remove the ability for counterfeit invoices to flow undetected inside of and between organizations. It brings trust, integrity, and reliability to invoices by notarizing them and uploading their digital fingerprint to the blockchain. This way corporations and stakeholders can always verify an invoice (or any other digital asset) they receive is authentic. The virtual, non-expiring warranty is backed by the immutable nature of blockchain. \n\n \n\n## **How CodeNotary Works**\n\nCodeNotary verifies integrity by matching a digital asset’s (e.g., invoice) ‘fingerprint’ to the ‘fingerprint’ that is stored on the blockchain. If the two fingerprints match, trust is verified. Furthermore, no matter where an invoice goes, it’s authenticity is verifiable as the fingerprint is stored forever on the blockchain. \n\n \n\nTo have a fingerprint verified is as simple as drag and drop. Currently, all a user has to do is drag the file they want to verify onto [**https://verify.codenotary.io**](https://verify.codenotary.io/). If the file has been signed by a CodeNotary user or organization, the individual doing the verification check will instantly see a green thumbs up. \n\n \n\n![CodeNotary - Drag & Drop - Verification - Verified](/images/blog/CodeNotary-Drag-Drop-Verification-Verified.190708-178x300.png)\n\n \n\nVerification is free for anyone, anywhere to use at any time. \n\n \n\nFor other ways to verify, check out our [**multiple ways to verify video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMXpNCMNsA4).\n\n \n\nTest out CodeNotary’s simple signing and verification for invoices and see for yourself.\n\n \n\n \n\n**[Start Your Free Trial](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)**\n\n \n\n**REFERENCES:**\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/28/how-to-avoid-invoice-theft-scam-that-cost-google-facebook-123m.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/28/how-to-avoid-invoice-theft-scam-that-cost-google-facebook-123m.html)\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47685094](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47685094)\n\n[https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/02/phishers-send-fake-invoices](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/02/phishers-send-fake-invoices)\n\n[https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/16914-bbb-tip-fake-invoice-scams](https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/16914-bbb-tip-fake-invoice-scams)\n\n[https://blogs.findlaw.com/in\\_house/2019/03/fake-invoice-scam-got-facebook-and-google-for-120m.html](https://blogs.findlaw.com/in_house/2019/03/fake-invoice-scam-got-facebook-and-google-for-120m.html)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/protecting-against-120mm-invoice-scam-loss-using-blockchain","extension":".md","slug":"protecting-against-120mm-invoice-scam-loss-using-blockchain","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624630},"$loki":48},{"title":"Protect Yourself from the Recent dockerhub.com Attack","image":"/images/blog/1280px-Docker_container_engine_logo.svg.png","date":"2019-05-01","toc":[{"id":"verify-container-authenticity-and-integrity","depth":2,"text":"Verify Container Authenticity and Integrity"},{"id":"enable-continuous-container-integrity-monitoring-with-the-vcn-watchdog","depth":2,"text":"Enable Continuous Container Integrity Monitoring with the vcn-watchdog"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"src":"/images/blog/1280px-Docker_container_engine_logo.svg.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Last week's "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19763413","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"dockerhub.com attack"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":" affects hundreds of thousands of accounts and exposes their containers to malicious code.

Create a **free** CodeNotary account\n        2. Sign the local copy of your Docker container image:\n            \n            **vcn sign docker://hello-world**\n            \n        3. Download your container image from [dockerhub.com](http://dockerhub.com/):\n            \n            **docker pull hello-world**\n            \n        4. Ensure the container image you pulled from [dockerhub.com](http://dockerhub.com/) has been signed with CodeNotary:\n            \n            **vcn verify docker://hello-world**\n            \n            If the output looks like the following, you can be sure that your code has not been tampered with:\n            \n            user@opa50:~$ vcn v docker://zerotrust/parity\n            Asset:   docker://7d2d42157acdabf4ae46a4815af9037179c871a3b20df628c997af5d452bd7ff\n            Hash:    7d2d42157acdabf4ae46a4815af9037179c871a3b20df628c997af5d452bd7ff\n            Date:    2019-05-01 14:00:35 +0000 UTC\n            Key:     0x2a4d3071a9d12e3886d43890d0dbaa8be60febec\n            Name:    docker://7d2d42157acdabf4ae46a4815af9037179c871a3b20df628c997af5d452bd7ff\n            Size:    270 MB\n            Company: vChain, Inc.\n            Website: [https://www.vchain.us](https://www.vchain.us/)\n            Level:   2 - SOCIAL\\_VERIFIED\n            Status:  **\"TRUSTED\"**\n            \n\n## **Enable Continuous Container Integrity Monitoring with the vcn-watchdog**\n\nMoreover, to avoid the risk of leaking any malware-injected software to our users and customers, we built a continuous integrity verification monitoring tool for our containers. The sidecar vcn-watchdog, we released on GitHub as an open source project constantly protects from unwanted, infected Docker container /images/blog. \n\nIntegrated with Docker, the watchdog continuously checks the container's integrity against its known, **CodeNotary**\\-signed image. If a container fails the verification check, an alert is sent to, in our case, our Slack account.\n\nThis is how you can quickly enable continuous integrity monitoring for your containers:\n\n1. 1. 1. Sign your locally stored container with CodeNotary:\n            \n             **vcn sign docker://ImageId** \n            \n        2. Check out https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn-watchdog on your server. The tool continuously verifies the integrity of your containers:\n            \n             **git clone https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn-watchdog.git** \n            \n        3. Edit the `verify` file and set the alerting/monitoring tool you are using (see the following instructions)\n        4. Make sure /var/run/docker.sock is accessible\n        5. Run with the following command on your server\n            \n             **docker-compose build && docker-compose up** \n            \n\nTo modify the `verify` file, hook up your alerting tool into the err() function. If you use Slack as we do, please do the following:\n\n1. 1. 1. Create a Slack Bot (Slack documentation **[here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115005265703-Create-a-bot-for-your-workspace)**) \n        2. Use the following code:\n            \n            **function err() {\n                echo \"Container ${1} (${2}) verification failed\" >&2\n                curl -q -X POST \\\\\n                    -H 'Content-type: application/json' \\\\\n                    --data \"{\\\\\"text\\\\\":\\\\\"Container ${1} (${2}) verification failed\\\\\"}\" \\\\\n            ** **\"https://hooks.slack.com/services/$TOKEN/$KEY\" > /dev/null 2>&1}** \n            \n\nOnce the set up is complete, if the verification fails, you will see the below message pop up in your Slack Bot notifications:\n\n![Slack Bot-CodeNotary-Docker Sync Alert Example](/images/blog/002_Alerting-on-Slack-example-1024x172.png)\n\n**Your container has been verified and is safe if you do not see the alert message.**\n\nIf you prefer to complicate your life and execute 13 time-consuming, manual steps every time you suspect you have been hacked, **[Madhuakula](https://blog.madhuakula.com/some-tips-to-review-docker-hub-hack-of-190k-accounts-addcd602aade)** outlined a step-by-step guide for coders who prefer that route.

Let's check some examples:\n\n \n\n#### **Example Telegraf on Github:**\n\nOn Github, the hash is mostly on the same page as the release, which is not recommended as we mentioned in a previous blog in this series (**here**) and know by now:\n\n \n\n[https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/releases](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/releases)\n\n \n\n![Telegraf on Github](/images/blog/1_Telegraf-on-Github-300x235.png)\n\n \n\n#### **Example: PuTTY Download page**\n\nSometimes the checksums are completely separated from the download links, which makes them more secure, but harder to check e.g. greenend.org.\n\n \n\n[https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)\n\n \n\nIn this example, you need to scroll down to the bottom of the page, download the checksum file and compare the generated checksum of the download with the one in the file.\n\n \n\n![PuTTY Download page](/images/blog/2_PuTTY-Download-page-300x162.png)\n\n \n\nFor simplicity reasons, I just downloaded the PuTTY binary and the SHA-256 file, and then used the online service [http://onlinemd5.com/](http://onlinemd5.com/) to verify the checksum.\n\n \n\nHowever, for stronger security, it is best to copy the filename of the downloaded file and search within the checksum file as its pretty big as you can see below:\n\n \n\n![Buried in the Checksum](/images/blog/3_Buried-in-the-Checksum-274x300.png)\n\n \n\nWithin the online calculator, you need to upload the “just downloaded” file, select the correct checksum type and copy/paste the checksum out of the checksum file into the ‘Compare with’ field.\n\n \n\n![MD5 and SHA Hash Generator](/images/blog/4_MD5-and-SHA-Hash-Generator-300x138.png)\n\n \n\nAnd here we go. The file integrity is ok.\n\n \n\n**Let’s be honest though, how often do you do that, especially if you are a high volume downloader?**\n\n \n\nAre you ready for another example?\n\n#### **Example: Filezilla Download page**\n\n \n\n![Filezilla Download page](/images/blog/5_Filezilla-Download-page-248x300.png)\n\n \n\nIn this case, the Checksums are in plain sight, but still kind of hidden. The last section after ‘Source Code’, is titled ‘Checksums’. But because of the same looking download link, it’s not so obvious to find.\n\n \n\nBut did you recognize the little ‘i’ icon behind each file? When clicking on that, the SHA-512 checksum will display:\n\n \n\n![Filezilla Download page-2](/images/blog/6_Filezilla-Download-page-2-300x206.png)\n\n \n\nBack to our online tool.\n\n \n\n![MD5 and SHA Hash Generator-2](/images/blog/7_MD5-and-SHA-Hash-Generator-2-300x136.png)\n\n \n\nDamn! There is no SHA-512, so I need to find another tool to compare it or use a local command.\n\n \n\nI tried this service here: [https://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm](https://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm) but the file was too large (5MB max).\n\n \n\nThen, I used [https://www.online-convert.com/](https://www.online-convert.com/) and uploaded the “just downloaded” file to the service.\n\n \n\n![online-convert.com](/images/blog/8_online-convert.com_-300x40.png)\n\n \n\nThat looks pretty similar. To make sure though, I really want to have an automatic comparison. So I go ahead and try the poor man solution. I copy the SHA-512 checksum from the online converter and search for it on the FileZilla website:\n\n \n\n![Filezilla Download page-3](/images/blog/9_Filezilla-Download-page-3-300x103.png)\n\n \n\nAs you can see, FileZilla was able to find the checksum but not before I had spent a lot of time and hassle making sure they matched.\n\n \n\nThese were just some examples, but you can already see that some effort is required if you want to make sure the file you download is really the file mentioned on the website. However, even if the two do match, it still is not entirely true that your file is safe as the download website might have been compromised and you just don’t know it. Thus, here your file downloading safety employs a bit of a hope-and-pray/fingers-crossed type strategy and hopefully, in the case of the downloader, the file mentioned on the website was not hacked.\n\n \n\n## **How to Create the Checksum in a Secure Way!**\n\n“Make sure the files are not being created by someone you don't trust or who might harbor malicious intent.”\n\n \n\nWhile the statement is obvious, if you use online platforms like [http://onlinemd5.com/](http://onlinemd5.com/) to create your checksum, you don’t really know if the checksum the platform provides is actually correct. You should only use online tools to _compare_ a checksum, while the initial checksum should be created locally on your computer with tools where you can view the source code!\n\n \n\nUsing CodeNotary, you can check the source code and even build the binary yourself. With CodeNotary, the created checksum is automatically and immutably stored, including its file attributes, on an Ethereum-based, consortium blockchain.\n\n \n\nIn addition, CodeNotary’s free-to-use webpage tool for verification, which you can see **[here](https://verify.codenotary.io)**, also includes a hash calculator display with MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes for any file that you drag and drop on to the page if you want to also manually check download integrity.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary - Drag & Drop - Verification - Verified](/images/blog/CodeNotary-Drag-Drop-Verification-Verified-186x300.png)\n\n \n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nUsing a download manager doesn’t mean the file you downloaded was actually the file you intended to download. In fact, if someone gains access to a website where the download link, as well as the checksum, are both on the same page/website, there is no protection left. An attacker can simply replace both the download link and the checksum. Thus rendering comparisons utilizing robust hashing algorithms, a fool’s errand. Download locations and checksum locations should be on separate server systems and require different credentials in order to access them. The manual process for generating checksums and comparing them to their website listed checksum counter-parts is an error-prone, optional, and an unsafe alternative.\n\n \n\nHaving a robust, redundant, and fault-tolerant blockchain-based checksum authentication system is simply a better way. The benefit for site owners using a blockchain-based system like CodeNotary is that download integrity would be one less thing they would have to worry about. The checksums of their original files would be immutably stored and publicly readable. For downloaders, they can feel at ease knowing they are protected against Man-in-the-Middle attacks (MIM). And any change, malicious or otherwise, to the original download file will inevitably be flagged by the immutable truth of the blockchain network.\n\n \n\nTry out CodeNotary’s one step verification for free and judge for yourself how easy it is.\n\n \n\n \n\n**[Yes, Let Me Try It Out](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)**\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/protecting-the-integrity-of-your-downloads-part-3","extension":".md","slug":"protecting-the-integrity-of-your-downloads-part-3","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624681},"$loki":50},{"title":"Securing your Azure DevOps Ecosystem, Jenkins and Kubernetes (AKS) using CodeNotary - Part 1","image":"/images/blog/jenkins_output_azure-1024x630.png","date":"2019-10-11","toc":[{"id":"jenkins","depth":2,"text":"Jenkins"},{"id":"login-as-admin","depth":2,"text":"Login as Admin"},{"id":"check-the-notarization","depth":2,"text":"Check the notarization"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Jenkins is one of the most popular CI/CD components in the DevOps world.

That way you an easily notarize everything that gets produced in your very own pipeline. If you want to double check the blog post - [please click here](https://www.codenotary.io/securing-your-azure-devops-ecosystem-jenkins-and-kubernetes-aks-using-codenotary-part-1/).\n\nThis second part covers the authentication process when your Jenkins pipeline deployed container into your Azure Kubernetes (AKS). That way you can make sure, that nothing unknown or unwanted runs in AKS. You can of course configure alerts as well.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Notarization and Authentication, please check this blog post first: [https://hackernoon.com/the-day-we-started-to-protect-devops-with-blockchain-a9g6y33gt](https://hackernoon.com/the-day-we-started-to-protect-devops-with-blockchain-a9g6y33gt)\n\nBut let's start step by step.\n\n## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\n\nAzure Kubernetes Service is an important part of the Azure DevOps Ecosystem and allows a very easy and straightforward deployment of services running on Kubernetes. The AKS environment used for this blog post has been nicely described here: [https://medium.com/@adilsonbna/building-my-own-azure-devops-ecosystem-ef92b8db9da5](https://medium.com/@adilsonbna/building-my-own-azure-devops-ecosystem-ef92b8db9da5)\n\n## Azure AKS Login\n\nAzure AKS can be added to your local kubectl config in a very simple way. Check your resource group and the name of the AKS deployment in your Azure Console:\n\n![Azure Ecosystem AKS](/images/blog/azure-kubectl-1024x432.png)\n\n```\n# add AKS access to .kube/config\naz aks get-credentials --resource-group DevopsEcosystem --name cniokubecluster\n```\n\nIf you don't have az installed, please check out the following page: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)\n\n```\n# list all Kubernetes services in the current namespace\nkubectl get svc\n```\n\n## Helm deployment\n\nThe easiest installation of CodeNotary for Kubernetes is using a helm chart (alternatives are described in the repository). If you haven't deployed helm yet, you can follow this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-helm).\n\nCreate a file helm-rbac.yaml\n\n```\n# create a tiller service account - helm-rbac.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: tiller\n  namespace: kube-system\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: tiller\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: cluster-admin\nsubjects:\n  - kind: ServiceAccount\n    name: tiller\n    namespace: kube-system\n```\n\nDeploy the Helm (Tiller) service account into your AKS\n\n```\nkubectl apply -f helm-rbac.yaml\n```\n\n```\n# install helm and deploy tiller\nhelm init --history-max 200 --service-account tiller --node-selectors \"beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux\"\n```\n\n```\n# check installed helm charts\nhelm list\n\n# check helm and tiller (server) version\nhelm version\n```\n\n## Azure AKS Kube-Notary deployment\n\nNow you can deploy Kube-Notary using helm by simply cloning the [repository](https://github.com/vchain-us/kube-notary) and issuing a helm install command.\n\n```\n# clone git repository\ngit clone https://github.com/vchain-us/kube-notary.git\ncd kube-notary\n\n# deploy Kube-Notary\nhelm install -n kube-notary helm/kube-notary --namespace=monitoring\n\n# you can check the status of Kube-Notary at any time using\nhelm status kube-notary\n```\n\nWhat happened when deploying the Kube-Notary helm chart?\n\nThe following resources are getting deployed to mainly support one Pod that consistently checks all running container /images/blog if they have been signed (you need a free account for that) using [CodeNotary](https://www.codenotary.io):\n\n- ClusterRole\n- ConfigMap\n- Deployment\n- Pod(related)\n- Service\n- ServiceAccount\n- ClusterRoleBinding\n\nPlease keep in mind, that Kube-Notary checks by default if a container image has been notarized on CodeNotary.io. But most of the time you only care about what you notarized, someone in your team or organization.\n\n#### Configure a list of trusted keys\n\nLists can be expressed by enclosing keys in `{` and `}` separated by `,`. For example:\n\n```\nhelm install -n kube-notary helm/kube-notary --set \"trust.keys={0x123..., 0x123...}\"\n```\n\n#### [](https://github.com/vchain-us/kube-notary#configure-a-trusted-organization)Configure a trusted organization\n\n```\nhelm install -n kube-notary helm/kube-notary --set \"trust.org=your.organization.com\"\n```\n\n#### [](https://github.com/vchain-us/kube-notary#note)Note\n\nIf both `trust.org` and `trust.keys` are set, only `trust.org` will be used.\n\nIf none is set, the last [signature](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/blob/master/docs/user-guide/signatures.md#signatures) by the signer with the highest available [level](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/blob/master/docs/user-guide/signatures.md#level) will be used during the verification.\n\nYou can find more information in the GitHub repository.\n\n## Check the Kube-Notary service\n\nKube-Notary comes with all common ways to extract information by default.\n\n1. Log output - to be consumed by ELK, Fluent or any other log collector\n2. Prometheus output - Kube-Notary pod gets automatically detected and scraped by a Prometheus server (if configured to scrape pods)\n3. json results page (can be checked manually or automatic)\n4. realtime status dashboard\n\nIf you want to check the output on your local system, you can use kubectl to forward the endpoint:\n\n```\n# find Service\nexport SERVICE_NAME=service/$(kubectl get service --namespace monitoring -l \"app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-notary,app.kubernetes.io/instance=kube-notary\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\")\n\n  # Metrics endpoint\necho \"Check the metrics endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:9581/metrics\"\nkubectl port-forward --namespace monitoring $SERVICE_NAME 9581\n\n  # Results endpoint\necho \"Check the verification results endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:9581/results\"\nkubectl port-forward --namespace monitoring $SERVICE_NAME 9581\n\n  # Status page\necho \"Status page at http://127.0.0.1:9581/status/\"\nkubectl port-forward --namespace monitoring $SERVICE_NAME 9581\n\n  # Stream logs\nexport POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace monitoring -l \"app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-notary,app.kubernetes.io/instance=kube-notary\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\")\n\nkubectl logs --namespace monitoring -f $POD_NAME\n\n```\n\nThe status page might look like that, depending on the number of notarized container /images/blog.\n\n- **Trusted**: you notarized the image (or someone, depending on you Kube-Notary configuration)\n- **Untrusted**: you untrusted the image (or someone, depending on you Kube-Notary configuration)\n- **Unsupported**: you unsupported the image (or someone, depending on you Kube-Notary configuration) . That's typically a good idea, when you release a newer image that should be used instead.\n- **Unknown**: Container image has not been notarized at all on CodeNotary.io\n\n![](/images/blog/kube-notary-status-1024x423.png)\n\nKube-Notary status page\n\n## Notarizing (Trust, Untrust, Unsupport) Azure AKS container /images/blog\n\nNotarizing the first /images/blog on CodeNotary is key for Kube-Notary to be useful. You can find a complete guideline how to work with CodeNotary here.\n\n[https://docs.codenotary.io/guide/quickhelp.html](https://docs.codenotary.io/guide/quickhelp.html)\n\nWhen you start using Kube-Notary, you might want to notarize the status quo and move on more strict afterwards. Honestly if you don't trust the container /images/blog that are currently running, that might be an issue anyway.\n\n```\n# Bulk sign all running \nexport POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace monitoring -l \"app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-notary,app.kubernetes.io/instance=kube-notary\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\")\n\nkubectl exec --namespace monitoring -t $POD_NAME sh /bin/bulk_sign > vcn_bulk_sign.sh\n\nchmod +x vcn_bulk_sign.sh && ./vcn_bulk_sign.sh\n```\n\nThe moment you start notarizing container /images/blog, you'll notice the changes in your Status Dashboard.\n\n## Prometheus and Grafana\n\nAs already mentioned, the Kube-Notary pod comes with Prometheus annotations and will be scraped immediately after the deployment, depending on your Prometheus configuration.\n\nYou can simply import the Grafana dashboard and you should see a nice dashboard version including notarization history.\n\nThe dashboard can be found here: [https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10339](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10339)\n\n![Grafana Azure AKS integration](/images/blog/kube-notary-1024x360.png)\n\n## Add your very own immutable Trust to any container image\n\nYou can finally add immutable trust to your DevOps pipeline. It doesn't matter if you want to authenticate Sourcecode, binaries, configuration files or container /images/blog - [CodeNotary vcn](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn) supports all of these objects.\n\nUsing [CodeNotary](https://www.codenotary.io) and the Kubernetes extension Kube-Notary allows you and your team to immediately secure and protect your running environment. No need to bother with complex GPG or TUF Notary installation, configuration and annoying digital certificates. CodeNotary doesn't change the objects, but calculates an unique checksum and stores that including your trust level in an immutable way.\n\n## [**Signup**](https://dashboard.staging.codenotary.io/auth/signup?license=NON_COMMERCIAL) today - completely free and without any risk\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/securing-your-azure-devops-ecosystem-jenkins-and-kubernetes-aks","extension":".md","slug":"securing-your-azure-devops-ecosystem-jenkins-and-kubernetes-aks","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624720},"$loki":52},{"title":"Staying Safe When Pulling from Maven Central and Other Repos","image":"/images/blog/CodeNotary-Maven-Integration-Graphic-300x232.png","date":"2019-05-22","toc":[{"id":"trusting-maven-dependencies","depth":2,"text":"Trusting Maven Dependencies"},{"id":"dependency-check-example","depth":2,"text":"Dependency Check Example"},{"id":"build-enforcement-test","depth":2,"text":"Build Enforcement Test"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"CodeNotary & Maven Integration Graphic","src":"/images/blog/CodeNotary-Maven-Integration-Graphic-300x232.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Maven works well, especially if you don’t want to rewrite a program from scratch every time you start up a project.

It manages builds and versions and is a central repository for dependencies that works much better than Ant. It also makes pulling in new features pretty easy. But what if you need to add a dependency to your system and you’re not pulling from Maven Central? What if you are but you still don’t know the code source? What if you’re working with a CI server? How do you know the code you pull is not malicious? You can use CodeNotary’s JVCN plugin to enforce Maven dependencies and immutably assure their safety.\n\n \n\nCodeNotary is the only decentralized, secure and blockchain based solution out there for enforcing and securing your Maven dependencies. See how it works below:\n\n \n\n## **Trusting Maven Dependencies**\n\n[CodeNotary](https://www.codenotary.io/) makes sure all your project dependencies, whether from Maven Central or other repos or servers, are trusted.\n\n \n\nGetting a closer look under the hood into the pom.xml, you can see CodeNotary has a couple of things going on to help you get security for your builds:\n\n \n\n1. The jvcn-maven plugin is hooked into the maven build process to automatically verify dependencies at build time.\n2. The JVCN plugin is set-up to verify all dependencies against a signer with the public-key 0xC498EEEbDcBd4047b7393573dB21099cE42638be\n3. The plugin is also configured to stop the build if it encounters a single non-trusted dependency.\n\n \n\nAnd now, we can go continuous without breaking a sweat over whether or not our latest build is safe to use. Just to illustrate, let’s run an example of CodeNotary's dependency enforcement at work.\n\n \n\n## **Dependency Check Example**\n\nIn this setup, for simplicity, we just have a single dependency:\n\n \n\nus.vchain:jvcn:0.0.1.\n\n \n\nSince, this dependency is signed with the blockchain stored, authentic hash, (below):\n\n \n\n0xC498EEEbDcBd4047b7393573dB21099cE42638be\n\n \n\n...the build passes.\n\n \n\n## **Build Enforcement Test**\n\nBy adding a new, unknown dependency to the project, you will be able to see the build enforcement in action.\n\n \n\nWe start our test by adding the following snippet to our dependencies list in pom.xml:\n\n \n\n<dependency\\>\n\n <groupId\\>org.postgresql</groupId\\>\n\n <artifactId\\>postgresql</artifactId\\>\n\n <version\\>42.2.5</version\\>\n\n</dependency\\>\n\n \n\nBecause the postgresql dependency was not signed with the same trusted hash we used previously (above):\n\n \n\n0xC498EEEbDcBd4047b7393573dB21099cE42638be.\n\n \n\n...the dependency is prevented from being used and the build fails. Clearly, if the key isn’t there, the lock won’t open and you remain protected.\n\n \n\nStay security thirsty my friends.\n\n \n\nIf you liked this blog, check out more cool CodeNotary integrations [here](https://www.codenotary.io/integrations/).\n\n \n\n \n\n[Yes!

They know security is important but with an often demanding schedule they end up concentrating on developing for functionality instead of security. This kind of thought process can lead to vulnerabilities in code and containers alike. “Security? With what time? My continuous integration backlog is overflowing.” We hear you. Security and integrity is a time-consuming responsibility but CodeNotary makes it easy for you to implement.\n\n \n\n## **Project Juggling and Development**\n\n \n\nWith time in limited supply, spending it wisely is a high priority for developers. That and effective time management is a widely sought after skill as well as an industry best practice. Coders are incessantly driving to maximize their productivity.\n\n \n\nNever ask a developer, “Really, how many lines of code did you produce today?”\n\n \n\nSpeed in DevOps clearly has its advantages but it can also lead to compromises due to hastily published misconfigurations and errors being put into production.\n\n \n\nCoding is a complex skill. It takes time to do it right. Considering miscommunications and everything else that can cause project backlogs to pile up ([here](http://www.projectcartoon.com/cartoon/2)’s a funny cartoon about it), time is in an ever-increasing shorter supply. This often leaves security concerns to become afterthoughts, if even that.\n\n \n\n## **Fallout from Continuous Integration**\n\n \n\nWith the never-ending battle between white hats and black hats and the constant march towards continuous integration inevitably leaving new zero-day exploits in its wake, new security measures are constantly emerging.\n\n \n\nThe good news is you can employ some good practices to help significantly mitigate your security risk.\n\n \n\nThe bad news is that they all take more of your time and tip the balance away from you doing what dev does best - writing code. For example, [this](http://www.devseccon.com/blog/2018/11/05/9-practical-steps-to-secure-your-container-deployment/) list by DevSecCon is a good set of 9 recommendations on how to secure containers before deployment. But what the list doesn’t do is help you to get more security in less time, which is the ideal.\n\n \n\n## **A Solution for Time-Crunched Devs**\n\n \n\nHere’s one solution we came up with to help you maintain 100% confidence in your containers and gain security over your build environments.

You can’t choose what number they call, they check it online using DUNS or other services. And this is just the beginning of how the code signing certificates' journey of pain saga continues. \n\nIf you haven't read part 1 in the Journey of Pain series, you can do so [here](https://codenotary.io/avoid-the-digital-and-code-signing-certificates-journey-of-pain/)\n\n## Next steps for creating a certificate aka having your teeth pulled\n\nDuring the automatic call, you need to write down a code, click on a link the CA provider sends via email and use the code to finalize the verification.\n\nThen you receive an email with a link, to create the certificate. That process is as annoying and cumbersome as the process was to get the license link itself.\n\nNow you need to use the same computer to generate the code signing certificate that you used to register with the CA. Unfortunately, I have several desktops and notebooks and the whole process started over 2 weeks ago. Luckily I used the Linux notebook I travel with (and not the one in the Houston office - as I wouldn’t have access to it for some weeks).\n\n![](/images/blog/img2.jpg)\n\nBtw when you try to generate with another system, you receive some warnings and errors as well.\n\nOh and when you use MS Windows, forget about Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, you are forced to use either Firefox or Internet Explorer.\n\nIf it worked, there are some articles about how to export your key:\n\n[https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/comodo/Knowledgebase/Article/View/1001/7/how-to-verify-your-code-signing-certificate-is-installed-windows](https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/comodo/Knowledgebase/Article/View/1001/7/how-to-verify-your-code-signing-certificate-is-installed-windows)\n\nIn my case I used Ubuntu, so I was forced to install Firefox, visit the Comodo page, accept the certificate and found my way to the certificate library of Firefox. I want to save you some time if you’re in the same situation and describe the steps it required.\n\n![](/images/blog/img3-1.jpg)\n\n1. Visit the page that Comodo (Sectigo) sends you with the exact same computer as you created the request and use Firefox (Linux) or Internet Explorer (Windows).\n2. Open the Preferences page of Firefox, select Privacy and Security (URL: about:preferences#privacy), scroll down and click View Certificates:\n\n![](/images/blog/img4.png)\n\n 3. Select the certificate you want to export the pfx file:\n\n![](/images/blog/img5.png)\n\n 4. Click Backup to export the certificate:\n\n![](/images/blog/img6.png)\n\nIt's highly recommended that you use a very strong password to protect your private key! It's very important to save the file in a safe location and make sure it's well protected!\n\n 5. Never ever send that file to anybody!\n\n![](/images/blog/img7.png)\n\n 6. Choose a filename and you can use a file extension .pfx.\n\nNow I have my private key as a pfx file secured by a strong password, but how to sign an executable?\n\n## **Code Signing in Windows**\n\nHere's the list of activities\n\n####  **1. Import PFX File.**\n\n![](/images/blog/img8.png)\n\nBefore you can start signing code you need to import the code signing certificates in your MS Windows Certificates Management.\n\nRight-click the code signing pfx file and select install pfx. You need to use the private key password that has been used for the certificate export. I used the machine certificate store and select personal as the location, but that’s up to you.\n\n####  **2. Download Signtool**\n\nI found these links on google but the installation fails under Microsoft Windows 10 despite the fact that all the articles are dated 2018:\n\n- [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/seccrypto/signtool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/seccrypto/signtool)\n- [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279)\n\n![](/images/blog/img9.png)\n\nA bit more digging brought up the Windows 10 SDK, which worked fine:\n\n[https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=698771](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=698771)\n\n![](/images/blog/img10.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/img11.jpg)\n\nYou only need the Software Development Kit packages - roughly 2GB!\n\n####  **3. Sign the executable using Signtool**\n\n![](/images/blog/img12.jpg)\n\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Windows Kits\\\\10\\\\bin\\\\x64>\n\nYou can find many examples to sign code here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/seccrypto/using-signtool-to-sign-a-file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/seccrypto/using-signtool-to-sign-a-file)\n\n####  **4. Sign using the pfx file**\n\nIf you don’t want to use the recommended way through an imported certificate, you can just use the pfx file and include the password. The following command is used to sign the Windows version of the vChain CodeNotary vcn command:\n\n**signtool.exe sign /f \"cert.pfx\" /p \"pass\" vcn**\n\nIf the signing process went well you should receive the Successfully signed message.\n\nYou can doublecheck the properties of the file if the code signing went well:\n\n#### ![](/images/blog/img13.jpg)\n\n####  **5. Code signing using an imported certificate**\n\nTo use the imported cert, we need to know where to find the certificate. Type certmgr to open the certificate manager and right click the correct certificate listing.\n\n![](/images/blog/img14.jpg)\n\nI’m going to use the vChain, Inc. certificate to sign the vcn executable. Let's get the cert location first to be used and then list the certificates:\n\ncertutil -enumstore\n\nShow all the certificates of the Personal certificate store:\n\ncertutil -store My \n\n![](/images/blog/img15.jpg)\n\nThat is the certificate I want to use, so I issue the signtool command and use the certificate Cert Hash.\n\ncd C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Windows Kits\\\\10\\\\bin\\\\x64\n\nsigntool.exe sign /sha1 \"5953c208a07beb5b59a1e142b1722b96ebfd6195\" vcn.exe\n\nIf it happens that you only have one code signing certificate, you can just use /a signtool.exe sign /a vcn.exe\n\nLuckily with [CodeNotary </>](https://codenotary.io), it is now possible to do all this in 1 simple step. Signing and verifying software have never been so easy and so secure.

Due to the fundamental nature of a blockchain and every node replicating the ledger at a regular clip, the surface size hackers have to attack compared to a traditional database is much larger. So blockchain sounds like a bad idea? Not really....if you use the right data strategy. The following blog is about the logic path we went down to arrive at our blockchain-based solution for storing sensitive customer data.\n\n \n\n## **Sensitive Data and the Blockchain**\n\nThere are numerous reasons sensitive data cannot go on a blockchain such as internal compliance policies, industry regulations, and privacy (e.g. the recent GDPR legislation in Europe), and many more.\n\n \n\nIn addition, blockchain operations are potentially slow and expensive. Smart contract development is also tricky. Compared to \"conventional\" data-stores smart contracts are hard to write, debug, migrate, secure, and perform searches on.\n\n \n\n## **Benefits of Blockchain**\n\nStill, even with all the extra complexities, we love blockchain. It enables tons of use cases and gives us immediate benefits that are extremely hard to achieve in conventional systems like:\n\n \n\n- Proving ownership\n- Proving data integrity \n- Streamlining business processes across multiple entities\n- Auditable and irrefutable chain of custody\n- Transparent, real-time insight\n- Tracking component life-cycles\n- Improved inventory management\n- Lowered administrative costs\n- Increased security and reduced risk\n\n \n\n## **Privacy and Regulatory Shortcomings of Blockchains**\n\nDespite the previously mentioned difficulties and because blockchain offers so many benefits, we thought through several approaches to dealing with the privacy and regulatory shortcomings of storing sensitive data on blockchains. \n\n \n\n### **Option #1 -  Forget About It**\n\nFirst, we should just acknowledge that blockchains offer a unique set of properties and are not a miracle solution for everything that ails us.

Good luck.\n\n \n\n**Option #4 -  Anonymizing**\n\nOf course, there’s the option to simply anonymize data. However, that is only partially useful as it does not make sense to display anonymized data to the customer. Furthermore, scrubbing data so it’s not personally identifiable can be done to various degrees. So that leaves you with a choice (or analysis) on how far and to what degree of anonymization you should use? Higher levels cost more in resource time, labor, and expense.

Both achieve the same basic goals of attributing trust, authenticating trust, and revoking trust. However, due to their underlying architectures, the way they each achieves those ends is very different. In this blog, we discuss many of the limitations GPG faces today, how prominent community members feel about the software, and how blockchain is being aptly applied to offer the same utility as GPG while delivering it with better user experience.\n\n \n\n## **A Side by Side Command Comparison of GPG & CodeNotary**\n\nDiving right into it, below is a side by side comparison of the commands needed to operate each software package through a command-line interface. As you can see, GPG requires 13 commands to perform the same functionality that CodeNotary achieves in just 3. \n\n \n\n**CodeNotary vcn Tool**\n\n**GPG**\n\n1\n\nNotarize an asset\n\n`vcn notarize`\n\n1\n\nSign an asset\n\n`gpg --sign`\n\n2\n\nAuthenticate an asset\n\n`vcn authenticate`\n\n2\n\nImport a sender’s public key / update senders’ keys via the keyserver\n\n`gpg --import` / `gpg --recv-keys`\n\n3\n\nRevoke an asset\n\n`vcn untrust`\n\n3\n\nSet trust level of imported key\n\n`gpg --edit-key`\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4\n\n \n\n`gpg> sign`\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n`gpg> trust`\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6\n\n \n\n`gpg> save`\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\nVerify an asset\n\n`gpg --verify`\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8\n\nRevoke a key\n\n`gpg --edit-key`\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n`gpg> revsig`\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10\n\n \n\n`gpg> save`\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\nUpload revocation certificate to keyserver\n\n`gpg --send-keys`\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12\n\nDelete private key\n\n`gpg> delete-secret-keys`\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\nDelete public key\n\n`gpg> delete-key`\n\n \n\nClearly, GPG does have the same level of usability that CodeNotary’s blockchain-based integrity service application does. Furthermore, some of the above-listed commands, i.e. anything executing interaction with the keyserver, are not practical anymore due to the demise of the recent keyserver attack it suffered, which we detailed in our recent blog [**here**](https://www.codenotary.io/gpg-certificates-maybe-permanently-poisoned-but-blockchain-offers-a-strong-alternative/). \n\n \n\n## **Commands Comparison Overview**\n\nGPG is overly complex. It’s not easy to use. In fact, to be successful with it, you have to get others to learn how to use it. Documentation is sometimes plentiful and sometimes sparse, depending on what you are looking for. It requires users to execute multi-step processes in order to verify and revoke trust, which is unnecessary, especially considering those actions can be performed by GPG alternatives each in a single step. Furthermore, GPG burdens users to maintain their own circles of trust (known as a user’s Web of Trust) and impractically passes the onerous responsibility of identity vetting to each individual user. \n\n \n\n## **Signing by the Asset vs Signing by the User**\n\nIn GPG, assets are signed with a user’s key. Due to the way in which GPG is constructed, once a signed asset is in the wild, it is extremely hard if not impossible to revoke the signature. As such the only alternative, is to revoke the key. The problem with that is then all the other assets that were signed with that key become distrusted, which was not the original intent of the revocation.\n\n \n\n## **Verification/Authentication**\n\nGPG signs a file by creating a new file and can only verify the newly created file. So if a user sends the original file and not the signed one, the receiver will have no idea of the true identity of the sender. \n\n \n\nAlso, trust cannot be communicated if the recipient of the signed file does not have a copy of the signer’s public key. This requirement adds multiple steps and additional friction to the verification process.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, the newly created signed file is the same size as the original file with some added code for the signature. This means for every file you want to have signed, you have to double your storage requirements. For data centers that operate on the petabyte level, this is ridiculous.\n\n \n\nThen, due to the recent Certificate Spamming Attack that essentially poisoned the trust well of GPG, the discovery of trusted public keys by unknown parties is now impossible. Now verification is limited to a user’s own sphere of connections. Users who don’t know each other aren’t able to trust each other and global, network-wide auditability is no longer possible. (This is a problem that a blockchain-based system like CodeNotary doesn’t have.) \n\n \n\nAlso, users who update to the latest release of GPG v2.2.17, follow the recommended setting updates and convert their keyring to the new GnuPG 2.2 format, their installation will not be compatible with older format versions that existed prior to the release of GnuPG 2.2. This means previously established trust is no longer visible and is effectively deleted for upgrading users. \n\n \n\n## **Revocation of Trust**\n\nRevoking trust in a key or signature in GPG is performed by using revocation certificates. For revoking signed files, this is done by appending the revocation certificate to the file. However, this is only effective if it is done prior to the file’s distribution. Post distribution, revoking a signature is extremely difficult, if not impossible. \n\n \n\nIn order to revoke a key, a user needs to create a revocation certificate for it and upload it to the keyserver so it can be seen by all GPG users. However, as of very recently, GPG suffered a crippling Certificate Spamming Attack in what some call the beginning of its total demise. As the only 100% mitigation, GPG recommends users immediately discontinue using the keyserver. Users are instructed to sever all connections with the GPG keyserver less they break their installation. Thus, global discoverability of revocation certificates is not possible, which means users now have no completely reliable way to know if the signatures they trust have been compromised or not. Consequently, GPG network-wide revocation is impossible and the legitimacy of the entire network is now thrown into question.\n\n \n\n## **Ease of Use** \n\nGnuPG is a complex tool with a lot of moving parts. As the old engineering adage goes, the more moving parts you have, the more chances there are for something to not work right. In fact, GPG is known to have weird bugs spring up during its use. Furthermore, it’s difficult to learn and unfortunately for GPG, it only has utility when a second person knows how to use it. This puts a huge damper on the number of people who can effectively use the tool. In contrast, the number of people who could benefit greatly from added levels of trust in the information age is significantly larger in orders of magnitude. If only GPG were simpler to use…\n\n \n\n## **Web of Trust**\n\nGPG does not have a formalized process for verifying user identities. Instead, it employs a concept that it dubs the Web of Trust (WOT). The WOT operates by having users independently verify other users before adding them to their trusted network. While an interesting model, this system has flaws. To GPG’s credit, they do try to encourage behavior that they see as supporting the WOT model.\n\n \n\nFor example, GPG documentation explicitly notes that it is selfish for an individual to sign their key with just enough confidence to satisfy their own needs as others will have more stringent security needs. As GPG points out, this is because signing keys with a lower level of confidence can weaken the Web of Trust and prevent user communication.\n\n \n\nHowever, there are a couple of problems here. First off, encouraging users to simply sign keys with higher levels of trust is not ideal as users may end up propagating a false level of security throughout their network, which will inevitably spill over into other users individual networks. Asking users to do so, if that is indeed what GPG is intending by the statement, will ironically only lead to what they are trying to prevent, i.e. a weaker Web of Trust. Though if this is not what GPG meant, and they instead meant something different, then the encouraging statement they made is another example of incomplete documentation.\n\n \n\nSecondly, the act of verifying every user in your network is not practical. This request is burdensome and is increasingly less capable of being fulfilled as a user’s network grows. GPG, in fact, understands this and has made it possible for users to allow other users to rate the trust level of someone else as their proxy. Unfortunately, this ends up making trust largely a function of social connection and less of verifiable identity. Yes, GPG requests users who attend key parties and use other mechanisms to verify new users’ identities (via ID or other means). But in reality, how sure are you that every person in your Web of Trust has been vetted to such a degree?\n\n \n\n## **Notable Community Members Have Issues with GPG**\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the creator of GPG, Phil Zimmerman, hasn’t used GPG in years. His given reason has been that his computer (a Mac) didn’t allow for GPG integration according to an [**interview**](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vvbw9a/even-the-inventor-of-pgp-doesnt-use-pgp) by Motherboard in Sept 2015. Since then, newer versions of Mac OS have allowed for the integration of GPG, though no word from Zimmerman on if he is now again using the program he built. \n\n \n\nRichard Stallman of OSS fame and the man responsible for launching the GNU Project (which GPG has taken a page from) 3.5 decades ago, posts on his [**blog**](https://stallman.org) to not trust any keys that are under his name on any keyserver.\n\n \n\nRobert J. Hansen, GPG’s unofficial crisis communicator and longtime supporter of the community, recently posted an oblique sounding commentary [**here**](https://gist.github.com/rjhansen/67ab921ffb4084c865b3618d6955275f) on the recent Certificate Flooding Attack. The attack has seemingly killed GPG’s ability to allow global verification by users who are unknown to each other. \n\n \n\n## **CodeNotary, a Blockchain-based, Better Alternative**\n\nCodeNotary is a blockchain-based alternative to GPG. It is a platform that proves digital asset integrity and excels over limitations that are inherent in GPG. CodeNotary works on the simple concept of if two hashes match (the blockchain stored hash and the local file hash), then trust is verified. Because it leverages blockchain technology, it is not encumbered with the limitations of both global discoverability and revocability in the GPG system. Instead of cumbersomely processing digital assets to ensure their integrity, CodeNotary’s `vcn` CLI integrity tool is simple and easy to use application that allows any user, anywhere, at any time to authenticate a digital asset in a single command. Similarly, CodeNotary’s `vcn` tool only requires a single command to notarize an asset as trusted or revoke an asset as untrusted. Try out the simplicity of CodeNotary for free and see the difference for yourself.\n\n \n\n[Start Free Trial](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n\n \n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c481.html](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c481.html)\n\n[https://www.gnupg.org/gph/de/manual/r1023.html](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/de/manual/r1023.html)\n\n[https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/OpenPGP-Key-Management.html#OpenPGP-Key-Management](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/OpenPGP-Key-Management.html#OpenPGP-Key-Management)\n\n[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG#Web\\_Key\\_Directory](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG#Web_Key_Directory)\n\n[https://www.vice.com/en\\_us/article/vvbw9a/even-the-inventor-of-pgp-doesnt-use-pgp](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vvbw9a/even-the-inventor-of-pgp-doesnt-use-pgp)\n\n[https://www.vice.com/en\\_us/article/d3devm/motherboard-guide-to-not-getting-hacked-online-safety-guide](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3devm/motherboard-guide-to-not-getting-hacked-online-safety-guide)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/the-cumbersome-nature-of-gpg-vs-an-easy-to-use-blockchain-alternative","extension":".md","slug":"the-cumbersome-nature-of-gpg-vs-an-easy-to-use-blockchain-alternative","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624811},"$loki":57},{"title":"The Distributed Ledger Technology at the Center of the Code Signing Disruption","image":"/images/blog/new-dashboard.png","date":"2019-04-01","toc":[{"id":"the-limitations-of-current-code-signing-practice","depth":3,"text":"The limitations of current code signing practice"},{"id":"codenotary-adds-trust-to-software","depth":3,"text":"CodeNotary adds trust to software"},{"id":"the-zero-trust-consortium-distributed-ledger-technology","depth":3,"text":"The Zero-Trust Consortium Distributed Ledger Technology"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ever since the software industry witnessed the introduction of code signing, software users have learned to rely on digital certificates and GPG to verify the integrity and identity of software.

The **[Zero-Trust Consortium](http://www.zerotrustconsortium.org/)** (ZTC) offered that immutable, unhackable, fast and always-on ledger capability thanks to its Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).\n\n### The Zero-Trust Consortium Distributed Ledger Technology\n\nThe ZTC is an independent, community-led membership group whose purpose is to support the usage of a fast distributed ledger, with no transaction cost, and built for the software industry, by the software industry. [vChain](http://www.vchain.us/), the company behind CodeNotary, worked with other notable founding members, such as **[Acronis](https://www.acronis.com/)** and **[Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)**, to create the first DLT for the software industry, and are now successfully recruiting new software companies who want to develop enterprise-ready applications using the blockchain technology without the limitation of the public ones.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2051\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"3470\"\\]![blockchain block explorer ledger distributed](/images/blog/ZTC-blocks.png) Screenshot of the ZTC Block Explorer\\[/caption\\]\n\nWith the public release of CodeNotary, vChain proved that the ZTC distributed ledger was up to its mission of making the DLT ready for enterprise-class software.\n\n \n\nStart your free trial on CodeNotary and see how easy and fast you can sign your code on an immutable distributed ledger.\n\n[Start Your Free Trial Today](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/the-distributed-ledger-technology-at-the-center-of-the-code-signing-disruption","extension":".md","slug":"the-distributed-ledger-technology-at-the-center-of-the-code-signing-disruption","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624818},"$loki":58},{"title":"The Failure of the Certificate Revocation List (CRL)","image":"/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-04-23-19.06.51-300x152.png","date":"2019-04-24","toc":[{"id":"overview","depth":2,"text":"Overview"},{"id":"what-is-the-revocation-process","depth":2,"text":"What is the revocation process?"},{"id":"what-happens-when-revocation-is-delayed-and-how-long-does-it-take-to-revoke-a-certificate","depth":3,"text":"What happens when revocation is delayed and how long does it take to revoke a certificate?"},{"id":"why-revoking-signatures-from-software-is-important","depth":2,"text":"Why revoking signatures from software is important"},{"id":"why-revocation-has-so-many-problems-and-is-basically-never-done-correctly","depth":2,"text":"Why revocation has so many problems and is basically never done (correctly)"},{"id":"how-codenotary-simplifies-the-revocation-process","depth":2,"text":"How CodeNotary simplifies the revocation process"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":2,"text":"Conclusion"},{"id":"references","depth":3,"text":"References"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"shattered-cracks-in-certificate-revocation-list-protocols-and-how-to-move-beyond-their-limitations"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#shattered-cracks-in-certificate-revocation-list-protocols-and-how-to-move-beyond-their-limitations","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"SHAttered: Cracks in Certificate Revocation List Protocols and How to Move Beyond Their Limitations"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"overview"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#overview","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Overview"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When cybercriminals mask themselves in a cloak of trust utilizing stolen, legitimate credentials in order to infect entities, programs, and code, the world has more often than not turned to utilize a certificate revocation list (CRL).

Regardless of whether its due to genuine concern or fear of getting it wrong, CAs delivering anything less than instantaneous and accurate results will always be below the bar as users can end up languishing in the in-between time with potential loss and damages to their finances and reputation.\n\n## **Why revocation has so many problems and is basically never done (correctly)**\n\nAccording to the same USENIX Security Symposium paper quoted above,\n\n>  \n> \n> _There are many cases that we have seen where clients are unable to check certificate revocation status due to:_\n> \n>  \n> \n> 1. _Missing CRLs points_\n> 2. Unreachable CRLs points\n> 3. CRLs that are no longer updated \n> 4. Revoked certificates that are mistakenly removed from a CRL\n> 5. Inconsistent responses from CRL\n> \n>  \n> \n> _These discoveries highlight various properties of the code signing PKI and its revocation process that should be monitored more actively_ _due to the security implications that they create__._\n\n \n\nIn addition, **CA’s are limited by what’s known as coarse granularity**. This means that they are significantly restricted in their ability to dive deep into their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) program and turn off, down to the individual customer or itemized product level, the validating certificate. Often times, CRL lists e.g. CRLsets only focus on high-value intermediate CA certificates or above.\n\n \n\nI personally know of a $3.4 billion technology corporation that tightrope walks on the scaffolding of only three digital certificates for everything that their organization produces. It’s just slightly ludicrous. Imagine if one of their certificates was invalidated. Their gigantic centralized point of failure would echo through stakeholder minds to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars if not more.\n\n## **How CodeNotary simplifies the revocation process**\n\n \n\nMany in the industry say the truth is that there is no reliable way to fix the problem, revocation is broken, that there is no dependable checking mechanism to facilitate the process properly.\n\n \n\nAs mentioned previously, coarse granularity only goes to exacerbate the problem of CAs. The funny thing is, a better way now exists. CA’s continuing to do business the way they have always done is really just a symptom of a larger complacency issue. The fact of the matter for the rest of us is that today we have a choice. CodeNotary utilizes **Distributed Ledger Technology** to give the owner of digitally certificated code the **ability to revoke a single certificate** any time of day or night.\n\n \n\nFor developers, product managers, security professionals, etc. the ability to **fine-tune the state of their digital certificate library** is immensely useful and powerful. Not to mention the fact that recall and revocation of their binaries can be done in a single, sweeping step.\n\n \n\nThe code snippets below are two examples of how CodeNotary allows for code revocation and the updating of your certificate and signature library.\n\n \n\n![](/images/blog/Screenshot-2019-04-23-20.42.05-300x88.png)\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nDevelopers no longer need to depend on a third party, ironically even if it’s their job, to manage their certificates efficiently and effectively. Today, **in a matter of seconds, not weeks, code can have its trust removed when needed**. Individual software, or even build components, can be invalidated, while all remaining code under management listed on your account remains authenticated.\n\n \n\nCodeNotary is a turnkey technology that’s ready-to-go and a 100% working and reliable solution for refusing malicious code connections. It does so with its request-response mechanism that can **revoke certificates in near real time**.\n\n \n\nWe always recommend following security best practices whenever one wants to rely on a certificate, but in case Murphy’s Law proves out, the thoroughness and instantaneousness of Distributed Ledger Technology, which CodeNotary is based on, can help save you from the effects of rainy day compromises.\n\n \n\n \n\n[Start CodeNotary for Free Today](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n\n### **References**\n\n \n\n- [https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/research-papers/the-broken-shield-measuring-revocation-effectiveness-in-the-windows-codes-signing-pki-en.pdf](https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/research-papers/the-broken-shield-measuring-revocation-effectiveness-in-the-windows-codes-signing-pki-en.pdf)\n- [http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~tdumitra/papers/CCS-2017.pdf](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~tdumitra/papers/CCS-2017.pdf)\n- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate\\_revocation\\_list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list)\n- [https://medium.com/@alexeysamoshkin/how-ssl-certificate-revocation-is-broken-in-practice-af3b63b9cb3](https://medium.com/@alexeysamoshkin/how-ssl-certificate-revocation-is-broken-in-practice-af3b63b9cb3)\n- [https://scotthelme.co.uk/alexa-top-1-million-analysis-february-2019/](https://scotthelme.co.uk/alexa-top-1-million-analysis-february-2019/)\n- [https://www.maikel.pro/blog/current-state-certificate-revocation-crls-ocsp/](https://www.maikel.pro/blog/current-state-certificate-revocation-crls-ocsp/)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/the-failure-of-the-certificate-revocation-list-crl","extension":".md","slug":"the-failure-of-the-certificate-revocation-list-crl","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624839},"$loki":59},{"title":"The Value of Timestamping Documents Through a Blockchain-based Notary","image":"/images/blog/Timestamp-Digital-Sig-232x300.png","date":"2019-08-29","toc":[{"id":"why-is-timestamping-important","depth":2,"text":"Why Is Timestamping Important?"},{"id":"what-is-a-timestamp","depth":2,"text":"What Is a Timestamp?"},{"id":"use-cases---value-of-timestamping-documents","depth":2,"text":"Use Cases - Value of Timestamping Documents"},{"id":"blockchain-replacing-traditional-notaries","depth":2,"text":"Blockchain Replacing Traditional Notaries"},{"id":"codenotary-blockchain-based-notarization","depth":2,"text":"CodeNotary, Blockchain-based Notarization"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Timestamp & Digital Sig","src":"/images/blog/Timestamp-Digital-Sig-232x300.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Since over 4 millennia ago, the recording of events and maintaining chronology has played a key part in the evolution of systems and society.

As HTTPS is only encrypting communication and makes sure the server name (FQDN) is the same as covered by the given SSL certificate, it can only protect against MIM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks. Such being the case, how do users confidently ensure the integrity of files when they use a download link? Read on to learn what the current established best practices are for ensuring file integrity when downloading as well as the potential dangers that exist around them.\n\n \n\n## **What Happens if you Click a Download Link on a Website?**\n\nYou typically download a file using a link that points directly to a download location, which is the most transparent case. Alternatively, sites will use a script to create an individual download link. The used browser is aware of a download request and starts using a built in mechanism i.e. a download manager to ensure the integrity of the data stream. Alternatively, it will rely on a lower-level protocol like TCP to provide this.\n\n \n\nOne can assume this is a reliable precaution against accidental corruption of files in transfer.\n\n \n\nDoing this means you can assume the download is only marked complete when the file integrity check has been successful.\n\n \n\nOf course, if you prefer, you can install an additional download manager to take care of the download action. Some common download managers include [Free Download Manager](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/) and [Persepolis](https://persepolisdm.github.io/).\n\n \n\n**However, in either case, using a download manager doesn’t mean the file you downloaded was actually the file you intended to download.**\n\n \n\n## **Ways to Corrupt a File Intentionally**\n\nWhen it comes to intentional corruption of files by a Man-in-the-Middle, any attacker who can modify the data-stream of the download can very likely also modify the data-stream which is used to transfer the checksum. As such, checksum verification is not an efficient security precaution. You might say, “But that’s covered by TLS and HTTPS communication.” Yes, that is true, but only if both the website and the download location are protected by HTTPS.\n\n \n\n**If someone gains access to the website where the download link as well as checksum are part of the same page or website, there is no protection left. The attacker can simply replace both the download link and checksum.**\n\n \n\nTherefore, the mentioned checksum (MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 are typically used) is only of value when the file advertising website and the file hosting website are under the control of different entities. A good example of this is when you outsource your downloadable files to a 3rd party file hoster.\n\n \n\n## **The Truth about Checksums**\n\nA cryptographic hash (sometimes called a ‘digest’) is a kind of ‘signature’ or ‘fingerprint’ for a text or a data file.\n\n \n\nA hash is not ‘encryption’. It cannot be decrypted back to the original text. It is a ‘one-way’ cryptographic function that is a fixed size for any size of source text. Thus, hashes are suitable for password validation, challenge authentication, anti-tampering, and digital signatures.\n\n \n\nLet’s get into the different checksum algorithms first:\n\n \n\nMD5: It’s the most popular checksum algorithm but it is completely broken from a security perspective. The probability of an accidental collision is still vanishingly small, but exists.\n\n \n\nSHA1: Secure Hash Algorithm generates an almost-unique 160-bit (20-byte) signature for any given text. However, SHA-1 is no longer recommended for cryptographic purposes. Google has now achieved a collision attack on SHA-1. While it might still be safe to use SHA-1 most of the time, the message is clear – switch to SHA-256 or SHA-3. There is a good description on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) if you’d like to learn more.\n\n \n\nSHA-256 or SHA-3: SHA-256 algorithm generates an almost-unique, fixed size 256-bit (32-byte) hash. SHA-256 is one of the successor hash functions to SHA-1, and is one of the strongest hash functions available.\n\n \n\nTruth is, while the checksum algorithm used might be pretty safe, the checksum calculation and comparison process is mostly manual. Even worse, it's not easy to understand!\n\n \n\nThe manual nature of the process also means that a website owner has to provide checksums to his users as a type of visual safety net. Unfortunately, now it's up to the downloading user to create a checksum of the downloaded file on his end in order to compare it with the website listed checksum.\n\n \n\n**That means it’s manual, error-prone, and optional AKA unsafe!**\n\n \n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nAs you can see, it’s easy to understand why many users might think their downloads are safe despite how illusory and thinly veiled that safety can actually be. In fact, clicking a download link may deliver an altered version and not the original file that was intended. The best practice of verifying the checksum of your downloaded copy and matching it to the publisher’s listed checksum is an unsafe manual and error-prone process.\n\n \n\nIn our next blog in this series, we will explore ways to use checksums and how to verify their correctness.\n\n \n\nIn the meantime, if you liked this blog and think code-signing and digital certificates are a good way to verify the integrity of a downloaded file, you’ll want to think again.

[https://github.com/katacoda/golang-http-server](https://github.com/katacoda/golang-http-server)\n\nFor our example its important that the repo contains a valid Dockerfile to build the container image.\n\nAfter we forked that project we need to add the Circle CI build configuration.\n\n### Create Circle CI config\n\nTo do so, simply create the file config.yml within the .circleci folder in the forked repository.\n\n![](/images/blog/repo-1024x497.png)\n\n### Define the Circle CI steps to create a validated build\n\nThe content of that config.yml file contains all the required steps to build:\n\nGeneral build setup\n\n```\nversion: 2\njobs:\n  build:\n    docker:\n      - image: golang:1.13.4-stretch\n    environment:\n      TEST_RESULTS: /tmp/test-results\n    steps:\n      - checkout\n      - setup_remote_docker\n```\n\n#### Prepare the remote docker client\n\n```\n# This should go into custom primary image, here's only for the sake of explanation\n      - run:\n          name: Install Docker client\n          command: |\n            set -x\n            VER=\"17.03.0-ce\"\n            curl -L -o /tmp/docker-$VER.tgz https://get.docker.com/builds/Linux/x86_64/docker-$VER.tgz\n            tar -xz -C /tmp -f /tmp/docker-$VER.tgz\n            mv /tmp/docker/* /usr/bin\n```\n\nDownload the latest CodeNotary vcn command line\n\n```\n      - run:\n          name: Download CodeNotary vcn binary\n          command: |\n            set -x\n            VER=\"v0.7.3\"\n            curl -L -o /tmp/vcn https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/releases/download/v0.7.3/vcn-$VER-linux-amd64\n            CHECKSUM=$(sha256sum /tmp/vcn | cut -d \" \" -f 1)\n            curl -s https://api.codenotary.io/authenticate/$CHECKSUM?org=vchain.us | grep -q :0\n```\n\nThe important pieces of that code snippets are the download of the latest version (please make sure to change the version accordingly), an independent calculation of the file checksum to do a validation. The [CodeNotary](https://www.codenotary.io) validation makes sure, that the downloaded binary has really been notarized by [vchain.us](https://www.vchain.us) the maker of the vcn cli:\n\n```\ncurl -s https://api.codenotary.io/authenticate/$CHECKSUM?org=vchain.us | grep -q :0\n```\n\nThe exit code is always 0 (success), when the checksum can be validated and has been notarized by a given organization.\n\n**That way, we can validate that we're not going to use a faked or tampered vcn!** The pipeline breaks, if no validation is possible.\n\n#### Move the vcn binary into the path and make it executable\n\n```\n      - run:\n          name: move CodeNotary vcn binary\n          command: |\n            chmod +x /tmp/vcn\n            mv /tmp/vcn /usr/local/bin/vcn\n```\n\n#### Build the docker image\n\n```\n      - run:\n          name: Build Docker image\n          command: |\n            TAG=\"0.1.${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM}\"\n            docker build -t codenotarydemo/demowebserver:$TAG .\n```\n\n#### Notarize the docker image including the Circle CI build number\n\n```\n      - run:\n          name: Notarize Docker image\n          command: |\n            TAG=\"0.1.${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM}\"\n            VCN_USER=${codenotary_user} VCN_PASSWORD=${codenotary_pass} vcn login\n            VCN_NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD=${codenotary_pass} vcn n --attr CircleCI=$TAG docker://codenotarydemo/demowebserver:$TAG \n```\n\nThis job makes sure the docker image is notarized before uploaded the Dockerhub, so nobody could intervene. For additional security, we add the CircleCI build number as well to the notarization process.\n\nPlease be aware, that we use different environment variables in that step that need to be defined in Circle CI.\n\n![validated builds - Circle CI environment variables](/images/blog/envvar-1024x542.png)\n\n#### Deploy the docker image to Dockerhub\n\n```\n      - run:\n          name: Push Docker image\n          command: |\n            TAG=\"0.1.${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM}\"\n            docker login -u ${docker_user} -p ${docker_pass}\n            docker push codenotarydemo/demowebserver:$TAG\n```\n\nOur last step of the pipeline makes sure the newly build docker container image is uploaded to our DockerHub.com repository using the correct tag. Please make sure to set the Circle CI environment variables for DockerHub as well.\n\n![validated build on dockerhub](/images/blog/dockerhub-1024x603.png)\n\n## Result\n\nLet's put all pieces together to a complete build flow for Circle CI (.circleci/config.yml)\n\n```\nversion: 2\njobs:\n  build:\n    docker:\n      - image: golang:1.13.4-stretch\n    environment:\n      TEST_RESULTS: /tmp/test-results\n\n    steps:\n      - checkout\n      - setup_remote_docker\n\n      # This should go into custom primary image, here's only for the sake of explanation\n      - run:\n          name: Install Docker client\n          command: |\n            set -x\n            VER=\"17.03.0-ce\"\n            curl -L -o /tmp/docker-$VER.tgz https://get.docker.com/builds/Linux/x86_64/docker-$VER.tgz\n            tar -xz -C /tmp -f /tmp/docker-$VER.tgz\n            mv /tmp/docker/* /usr/bin\n\n      - run:\n          name: Download CodeNotary vcn binary\n          command: |\n            set -x\n            VER=\"v0.7.3\"\n            curl -L -o /tmp/vcn https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/releases/download/v0.7.3/vcn-$VER-linux-amd64\n            CHECKSUM=$(sha256sum /tmp/vcn | cut -d \" \" -f 1)\n            curl -s https://api.codenotary.io/authenticate/$CHECKSUM?org=vchain.us | grep -q :0\n\n      - run:\n          name: Authenticate and move CodeNotary vcn binary\n          command: |\n            chmod +x /tmp/vcn\n            mv /tmp/vcn /usr/local/bin/vcn\n\n      - run:\n          name: Build Docker image\n          command: |\n            TAG=\"0.1.${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM}\"\n            docker build -t codenotarydemo/demowebserver:$TAG .\n\n      - run:\n          name: Notarize Docker image\n          command: |\n            TAG=\"0.1.${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM}\"\n            VCN_USER=${codenotary_user} VCN_PASSWORD=${codenotary_pass} vcn login\n            VCN_NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD=${codenotary_pass} vcn n --attr CircleCI=$TAG docker://codenotarydemo/demowebserver:$TAG \n\n      - run:\n          name: Push Docker image\n          command: |\n            TAG=\"0.1.${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM}\"\n            docker login -u ${docker_user} -p ${docker_pass}\n            docker push codenotarydemo/demowebserver:$TAG\n```\n\nWhen all went well, you should see the build process starting with your config.yml change and everything running through.\n\n![Circle CI build successful](/images/blog/pipeline-1024x721.png)\n\n## Validate the uploaded docker image\n\nAs this run was the first to happen, let's make sure the notarization of the image went well and anyone in the world is able to validate the build.\n\nTherefore, lets pull the uploaded image to a complete different system and use [vcn to authenticate all information](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn).\n\n**docker pull codenotarydemo/demowebserver:0.1.4**\n\n**vcn authenticate docker://codenotarydemo/demowebserver:0.1.4**\n\n![validate build using vcn](/images/blog/vcn-a.png)\n\nAll checks were successful and we're sure to not release any software, container image or other artifact that cannot be validated.\n\nIf you're serious about security, DevSecOps and build validation, there is no excuse anymore as its free:\n\n[Sign Up for build validation](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/validated-builds-using-circleci-ci-cd","extension":".md","slug":"validated-builds-using-circleci-ci-cd","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624888},"$loki":63},{"title":"Using Blockchain to Protect Against Wire Fraud Scams","image":"/images/blog/Attacker-walking-through-a-key-hole-300x169.jpg","date":"2019-08-08","toc":[{"id":"liability","depth":2,"text":"Liability"},{"id":"overview-of-attack-types","depth":2,"text":"Overview of Attack Types"},{"id":"the-role-of-social-engineering","depth":2,"text":"The Role of Social Engineering"},{"id":"data-security-best-practices","depth":2,"text":"Data Security Best Practices"},{"id":"preventing-fraud-with-blockchain","depth":2,"text":"Preventing Fraud with Blockchain"},{"id":"how-codenotary-works","depth":2,"text":"How CodeNotary Works"},{"id":"see-codenotarys-authentication-in-action","depth":2,"text":"See CodeNotary’s Authentication in Action"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Attacker walking through a key hole","src":"/images/blog/Attacker-walking-through-a-key-hole-300x169.jpg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"2018 witnessed a near doubling of the amount of money lost to cybercriminals at an alarming $2.7 billion according to the latest FBI Internet Crime Report.

The figure takes into account various types of internet fraud, including those that utilize irreversible wire transfers, which attackers love. In our previous blog in the series [here](https://www.codenotary.io/protecting-against-120mm-invoice-scam-loss-using-blockchain/), we talked about invoice fraud. This blog discusses the liability companies and individuals bare when attacks happen, various different tactics hackers use to achieve fraudulent wire transfers, best practices for data security, and how to mitigate the risk and fallout of an attack using blockchain.\n\n \n\n## **Liability**\n\nLiability is part and parcel with doing business. In the real estate industry, no professional is absolved from the liability of a data breach. If you are in possession of a client’s sensitive data and it’s stolen, both you and your company are liable. This applies to agents, lawyers, brokers, and anyone else who is even a temporary custodian of a client’s sensitive information, regardless if they are actually initiating fund transfers or not. \n\n \n\nFor example, in the real estate industry, one of the biggest claims made against agents today is due to client data compromise. Across industries, data breaches directly cost businesses an average of $3,000,000. However, that figure doesn’t include the $1,300,000 average cost of lost business that happens in the wake of compromise, which brings the grand total to businesses to $4,300,000 per compromise.\n\n \n\n## **Overview of Attack Types** \n\nHackers use a variety of ways that lead to their ability to carry out wire fraud. To steal social security numbers, names and addresses, bank account numbers, pin codes, and other financial information, hackers combine tactics such as:\n\n \n\n- **Malware**: software used to gain access to legitimate computer or communication systems e.g. email threads containing financially relevant data. The hacker uses the information to mask themselves from security detection efforts when they execute fraudulent wire transfer requests. \n- **Spear-phishing**: Emails from a bad actor impersonating a trusted sender used to entice victims into revealing confidential information. \n- **Spoofing email accounts and websites**: Legitimate addresses with slight variations in them that are used to fool victims into thinking fake accounts are authentic. For example, [adam.kelly@commerce.com](mailto:adam.kelly@commerce.com) vs [adam.keIIy@commerce.com](mailto:adam.keIIy@commerce.com), which look virtually identical because of the swap between the lower-case l’s and the capital I’s. \n\n## **The Role of Social Engineering**\n\nIn addition to the above-listed tactics, hackers employ what’s known as social engineering. It attacks the human element of security. Specifically, social engineering refers to the use of deceptive techniques to manipulate a person into breaking standard security practices and disclosing personal or confidential information. And it doesn’t matter how much money or resources a company threw at securing their network, the human element is a large and constant vulnerability for hackers to exploit. Security protocols can help protect a company. However, there is always the human element to consider. \n\n \n\n**[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc7scxvKQOo)**’s a good, 2.5-minute video from DefCon on just how easy social engineering is. It shows a social engineer gaining access to the interviewer’s phone account, adding her name to his account, and changing his password within just a few minutes using nothing more than a YouTube video of a crying baby and some wit. This type of attack can blast right through the most state-of-the-art security. \n\n \n\nThat said, it is still wise to implement security measures data protection. \n\n \n\n## **Data Security Best Practices**\n\nThere are numerous best practices organizations can employ to help protect against data compromise. Here is a list of several:\n\n \n\n- Always follow up an email containing wire instructions with a phone call before sending any funds. \n- Create a data retention policy and delete or destroy all out of date documents.\n- Establish an electronic records management system.\n- Continuously create data backups so nothing is lost in the event of compromise.\n- Use file integrity software to ensure assets are not unknowingly changed while at rest.\n- Enforce a policy to restrict access to sensitive data to only approved devices and personnel.\n- Keep antivirus, firewall, and all other security software up to date with the latest versions and perform software reviews on a quarterly or biannual basis. \n\n \n\n## **Preventing Fraud with Blockchain**\n\nCodeNotary is a platform that ensures the integrity of clean, trusted software-based assets that are in use or at rest. By independently notarizing and attaching their identity and trust to any digital asset, individuals and organizations can ensure their integrity. The intelligence that CodeNotary delivers is based on a combination of blockchain technology and Know Your Customer practices. This way team members, stakeholders, and consumers can know if an asset is trusted, who testified to its trustworthiness and how they have proven who they are. In short, CodeNotary transforms trust from an implicit assumption to an explicit authentication for anyone, anywhere, at any time. \n\n \n\n## **How CodeNotary Works**\n\nCodeNotary works on a simple premise. If the digital fingerprints of two compared files match, trust is authenticated. One fingerprint is of the digital asset that is being authenticated, while the other belongs to a known safe version of the file that was previously recorded to the blockchain. This way stakeholders and corporations can always authenticate their files containing sensitive financial information and wire instructions have not been changed maliciously or by an unauthorized user, even in the aftermath of compromise. \n\n \n\n## **See CodeNotary’s Authentication in Action**\n\nIn two quick steps, you can witness CodeNotary in action.\n\n \n\n1.

But did you know `vcn` can actually be utilized in a more customized way? It has been designed to allow a developer to import the `vcn` Golang code within his/her own project in order to directly verify digital asset integrity against the immutability of the blockchain.\n\n \n\nFor more information on how to sign digital assets, check out our help guide [here](https://www.codenotary.io/help/#vcn_command_line) or our onboarding video [here](https://youtu.be/GrlygvXF1XE?t=421) (it starts at the signing process). And for more on signing with Golang, see our blog [here](https://www.codenotary.io/integrating-blockchain-based-code-signing-into-your-application-using-golang/).\n\n## **Asset Verification**\n\nVerifying the assets that your application draws on is in line with the DevSecOps best practice of Zero Trust. When running applications, it’s critical to know if an asset (code, image, container, file, application, etc.) has been modified and is truly safe to run in your environment. Knowing the digital asset integrity will help alert you to any potential runtime errors caused by unknown updates as well as any malicious tampering.\n\n \n\n## **Using Verification in Your Go Code**\n\nWe created `vcn` so it can be utilized directly from within an individual application’s code structure. Extracting and placing a global verification checker like `vcn` directly into your project gives you the ability to configure it to run whenever you need or want it to do so.\n\n \n\nHere’s a very basic example for including asset verification in your code:\n\n \n\n```\npackage main\n \nimport (\n\n   “fmt”\n\n  “github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/api”\n  “github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/meta”\n)\n\nfunc main()  {\n      verification, err := api.BlockChainVerify(“<asset hash here>”)\n      if err != nil {\n            panic(err)\n      {\n      fmt.Println(“Asset status: “ + meta.StatusName(verification.Status))\n}  \n```\n\n \n\n## **How It Works**\n\nThe github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/api package pulls in the `vcn` API and makes it able to read directly from the blockchain. The `api.BlockChainVerify` function then calls the blockchain to see if it recognizes a hash of a specific asset, which is the input. Assuming it does, the function then prints the verification status i.e. TRUSTED, UNTRUSTED, UNSUPPORTED, UNKNOWN. If any error occurred (e.g. a connection error), the program will panic.\n\n \n\nOnce you have a printed verification status confirmed by the blockchain, the application possibilities begin to unfold.\n\n \n\nWe also provided another function, `BlockChainVerifyMatchingPublicKeys`, you can use if you have an asset you want to trust that needs to be verified against a list of signers. It behaves the same as `BlockChainVerify` with the difference being it checks against a list of signers instead of hashes. The function is a bit more behind the scenes and lower level but it is there so you can use it if you have a use case that requires it. You can read more about it on our GitHub page: [https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn#verify-by-a-list-of-signers](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn#verify-by-a-list-of-signers)\n\n \n\nFor more information on `BlockChainVerify`, check out:\n\n- Our API documentation [https://godoc.org/github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/api#BlockChainVerify](https://godoc.org/github.com/vchain-us/vcn/pkg/api#BlockChainVerify)\n- The source code on GitHub [https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/blob/master/pkg/api/verify.go#L109](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/blob/master/pkg/api/verify.go#L109)\n\n \n\n## **Testing**\n\nWe have built in a `make test` command in `vcn` so you can set up and run your own test prior to pushing any code live. You can find more documentation at [https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn#testing](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn#testing)\n\n \n\nIn addition, we are constantly testing and maintaining the blockchain as a member and steward of its community.\n\n \n\nNow, let’s look at some use cases and a current example of the `vcn` API being used today.\n\n## **Use Case Examples**\n\nFor example, say your project relies on spinning up a container every time before it can perform its goal functionality. You can set `vcn` to run a verification check just prior to the container running to make sure it is the container you expect it to be and that it has not been tampered with.\n\n \n\nAnother example involves checking dependencies. Say you have dependencies that you have used before but need to make sure they are still legit and untampered before you connect to them again. You can use `vcn` in your project code to verify that the dependencies are 100% as intended.\n\n \n\nFor an example currently in use, check out how we used the API internally to implement the `vcn` verify command:\n\n[https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/blob/master/pkg/cmd/verify/verify.go#L99](https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/blob/master/pkg/cmd/verify/verify.go#L99)\n\n \n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nIncluding a global verification check inside your code is a great way to add value to the users of your project. Applications that confirm digital asset integrity and all its various components and dependencies give users increased reliability, security, and peace of mind.\n\n \n\nYou can find the entire `vcn` project on our GitHub repository.\n\n \n\n \n\n[Show Me to the Repo](https://github.com/vchain-us)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/verify-digital-asset-integrity-against-the-blockchain-for-free-using-golang","extension":".md","slug":"verify-digital-asset-integrity-against-the-blockchain-for-free-using-golang","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624927},"$loki":67},{"title":"Verify the Integrity of a Docker Image for Free with CodeNotary","date":"2019-05-09","toc":[{"id":"1--sign-your-docker-images","depth":3,"text":"1)  Sign Your Docker Images"},{"id":"2--verify-your-docker-images","depth":3,"text":"2)  Verify Your Docker Images"},{"id":"3--verify-your-container-image-before-running","depth":3,"text":"3)  Verify Your Container Image Before Running"},{"id":"4--verify-the-integrity-of-running-docker-images","depth":3,"text":"4)  Verify the Integrity of Running Docker Images"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":2,"text":"Conclusion"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"With CodeNotary you can finally verify that your "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Docker"}]},{"type":"text","value":" /images/blog are "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"safe, untampered, and authentic."}]},{"type":"text","value":" Thanks to "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"blockchain technology and smart contracts, CodeNotary"}]},{"type":"text","value":" allows you to immutably sign your /images/blog so that you can always "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"verify their integrity"}]},{"type":"text","value":" easily, instantly and for free.

In this blog, we look at what checksums are and how to use them. Specifically, we walk through how the Webmaster uploader and the user downloader can generate checksums on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux based machines.\n\n## **What is a checksum?**\n\nA checksum is a value used to verify the integrity of a data transfer or a file. Typically, checksums appear as a long, alphanumeric string of characters that acts as a digital fingerprint of sorts. They are used as a way to compare an original file to a copied version of that file in order to ensure they are the same. If the checksums calculated don’t match, even if they are just slightly different, the data has either been corrupted or (maliciously) tampered with.\n\n \n\n## **How to Use Checksums**\n\nNow let’s see how to use a checksum from both the uploader and downloader’s perspective. Here we cover SHA256 as its considered a best practice.\n\n \n\n### **As a Webmaster or “Uploader”**\n\nCreate or obtain the file from your trusted source and use a checksum tool that fits your operating system:\n\n \n\n**On Microsoft Windows**\n\nSHA256 checksum can be generated in the console using the following command:\n\n \n\n`certutil -hashfile C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\Upload\\file.exe SHA256`\n\n \n\nInstead of typing the path to the file, you can just drag and drop:\n\n \n\n1. Press Windows Start Menu\n2. Type cmd\n3. You should see command (cmd) execute (.exe) option in the list of results. Click on it to launch.\n4. Type or paste: `certutil -hashfile`\n5. Press space\n6. Drag and drop the file from Explorer to Terminal\n7. Press space\n8. Type or paste: `SHA256`\n9. Press enter key\n10. You should see the resulting string output on the second line is the SHA256 checksum\n\n \n\n**macOS**\n\nSHA256 checksum can be generated using the following command:\n\n \n\n`$ shasum -a 256 ~/Upload/file`\n\n \n\nInstead of typing the path to the file, you can just drag and drop:\n\n \n\n1. Open Terminal\n2. Type or paste: `shasum -a 256`\n3. Press space key\n4. Drag and drop file from the Finder to Terminal\n5. Press enter key\n\n \n\n**Linux**\n\nGenerate the SHA256 hash by entering:\n\n \n\n`$ sha256sum ~/Upload/file`\n\n \n\n#### Upload the file and the Checksum\n\nAfter uploading the files to the intended location, you need to create a website with the download links. Also, you should include a file link to the created checksums or have them integrated it into the website.\n\n \n\nOne issue to be aware of here is the download location and the checksum location should be on separate server systems. Additionally, a best practice is to require different credentials for accessing either location. However, doing so makes the Webmaster’s life pretty tough, especially when they have a significant amount of files available for download.\n\n \n\n### **As a “Downloader”**\n\nWhen you download a file from any website on the web, you need to generate the checksum using the same hashing algorithm as the “Uploader” and compare your result to the result posted on the download website. Though the process is essentially the same for calculating the checksums, we re-illustrated it below for clarity.\n\n \n\n**On Microsoft Windows**\n\nSHA256 checksum can be verified using the following command:\n\n \n\n`certutil -hashfile C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\downloads\\file.exe SHA256`\n\n \n\nInstead of typing the path to the file, you can just drag and drop:\n\n \n\n1. Press Windows Start Menu\n2. Type cmd\n3. You should see command (cmd) execute (.exe) option in the list of results. Click on it to launch.\n4. Type or paste: `certutil -hashfile`\n5. Press space\n6. Drag and drop the file from Explorer to Terminal\n7. Press space\n8. Type or paste: `SHA256`\n9. Press enter key\n10. You should see the resulting string output on the second line is the SHA256 checksum\n\n \n\n**macOS**\n\nSHA256 checksum can be verified using the following command:\n\n \n\n`$ shasum -a 256 ~/downloads/file`\n\n \n\nInstead of typing the path to the file use drag and drop:\n\n \n\n1. Open Terminal\n2. Type or paste: `shasum -a 256`\n3. Press space key\n4. Drag and drop the file from the Finder to Terminal\n5. Press enter key\n\n \n\n**Linux**\n\nVerify the SHA256 hash:\n\n \n\n`$ sha256sum ~/downloads/file`\n\n \n\n## Check Checksums Easy With CodeNotary Drag & Drop\n\nCodeNotary's drag and drop verification page is used to verify a digital asset's integrity. It checks to see if the asset has been signed by CodeNotary and has had it's unique 'fingerprint', its hash, immutably added to the blockchain. \n\n \n\nA bonus is that the page has the added benefit of being a hash calculator. For any asset, signed or unsigned, that is drag and dropped onto the page [here](https://verify.codenotary.io/), it will display and automatically calculate the MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes for that asset.\n\n \n\n![CodeNotary - Drag & Drop - Verification - Verified](/images/blog/CodeNotary-Drag-Drop-Verification-Verified-186x300.png)\n\n \n\nOne of the nice aspects of the calculator in comparison to online checksum tools is that you don't have to upload the file you want to check.  You just drop it. \n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nCalculating checksums is not a difficult process and is mathematically sound, but it does take time away from what you would rather be doing. If you are constantly downloading or uploading files, calculating and comparing checksums can become a cumbersome annoyance.\n\n \n\nFor more on the truth about checksums and what current best practices are for ensuring file integrity when downloading from the web as well as what potential dangers they have, check out our blog on ‘The Problem with Using Download Links.’\n\n \n\n \n\n[Yes, I’d Like to Read That](https://www.codenotary.io/the-problem-with-using-a-download-link/)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/what-are-checksums-and-how-to-calculate-them-for-downloads","extension":".md","slug":"what-are-checksums-and-how-to-calculate-them-for-downloads","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624956},"$loki":69},{"title":"What is Docker and How Does It Work?","image":"/images/blog/docker-logo-posters-talisso-redbubble-docker-logo-300x300.jpg","date":"2019-06-03","toc":[{"id":"what-is-docker","depth":2,"text":"What is Docker?"},{"id":"what-are-the-basics-of-docker-architecture","depth":2,"text":"What are the basics of Docker architecture?"},{"id":"when-should-i-use-docker-and-what-is-its-advantage","depth":2,"text":"When should I use Docker and what is its advantage?"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":2,"text":"Conclusion"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"docker-logo","src":"/images/blog/docker-logo-posters-talisso-redbubble-docker-logo-300x300.jpg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In March 2013, Docker was released as open source software and made its debut to the public.

Below is a quick guide to what is Docker, how it works, its base architectural elements, and its main advantages.\n\n \n\n## **What is Docker?**\n\nDocker gives a user the ability to create, ship, and run any application on any infrastructure by using what’s known as containers. It is container architecture, as opposed to the virtual machine alternative, that is able to execute packaged functions with a significant reduction in network latency. In other words, Docker can do the same job but faster. This is, in part, due to the fact that Docker doesn’t require a hypervisor layer and taps directly into the kernel of a host machine.\n\n \n\n## **What are the basics of Docker architecture?**\n\nBelow are some of the basic key concepts used in the Docker domain:\n\n \n\n- **Dockerfile** is a text document of build instructions Docker uses to create an image. The file contains everything that is needed to build up a container including all configuration specs and commands. It’s essentially a recipe for ‘cooking up’ a Docker image.\n- **Docker Image** is an instruction template for how to create a container. It is a snapshot of the recipe that was in the Dockerfile at a specific point in time.\n- **Docker Image Tag** is used to identify different versions of an image.\n- **Docker Container** is the runnable instance of a Docker image. It is an application layer abstraction that contains both the code and its dependencies. The act of running an image creates a container.\n- **Docker Repository** is a single, centralized location within the Docker domain where container /images/blog are published (pushed), stored, searched, downloaded (pulled), and managed. They can be either remote or on premise or public or private and usually hold multiple versions of a specific image.\n- **Docker Registry** is an open-source community location that stores a collection of Docker domain based repositories.\n- **Docker Hub** is a cloud-based version of Docker Registry.\n- **Docker Engine** is an open source containerization tool that includes a workflow for building and containerizing applications. It provides a universal packaging format that enables applications to run anywhere consistently on any machine utilizing Docker components and services. Docker Engine also creates a server-side daemon process for hosting containers, /images/blog, networks and storage volumes.\n\n \n\n## **When should I use Docker and what is its advantage?**\n\nDocker assures that applications and systems behave the same regardless of the number of times they have been deployed. It works best with applications that are small and have a singular purpose. As such, Docker forces developers to lean towards creating minimally sized containers. Iterating development with smaller containers reduces complexity favoring predictability and rapid delivery as well as minimizing system drift.

It solves the ‘dependency hell’ problem in addition to the annoying and unhelpful co-worker comment, “It works on my laptop”.\n\n \n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nSo what is Docker? In summary, Docker is a leader, with its strongly recommended container minimization and platform agnosticism, that has caused the software industry to shift towards the rise of microservices. The reason it has made such a large contribution is that it simply makes developers lives easier and production schedules drastically shorter.\n\n \n\nFor more information on how to secure the integrity of your Docker /images/blog and containers, check out our blog on how to get free integrity verification for Docker /images/blog.\n\n \n\n[Yes, Take Me to the Blog](https://www.codenotary.io/verify-the-integrity-of-a-docker-image-for-free-with-codenotary/)\n\n \n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[https://docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/)\n\n[https://blog.codeship.com](https://blog.codeship.com/what-is-a-dockerfile/)\n\n[https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/definition/Docker-Hub](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/definition/Docker-Hub)\n\n[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/docker\\_hub.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/docker_hub.htm)\n\n[https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2016/what-is-docker-containers/](https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2016/what-is-docker-containers/)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/what-is-docker-and-how-does-it-work","extension":".md","slug":"what-is-docker-and-how-does-it-work","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624964},"$loki":70},{"title":"What are Digital Signatures and How do They Work?","image":"/images/blog/Digital-Sig-300x161.png","date":"2019-08-15","toc":[{"id":"history-of-digital-signatures","depth":2,"text":"History of Digital Signatures"},{"id":"digital-signatures-the-basics","depth":2,"text":"Digital Signatures, the Basics"},{"id":"hashes-and-digital-signatures","depth":3,"text":"Hashes and Digital Signatures"},{"id":"overview-of-how-digital-signatures-work","depth":2,"text":"Overview of How Digital Signatures Work"},{"id":"the-digital-signing-process","depth":2,"text":"The Digital Signing Process"},{"id":"anatomy-of-a-signed-document-source-data","depth":2,"text":"Anatomy of a Signed Document (Source Data)"},{"id":"digital-signatures-and-forgery","depth":2,"text":"Digital Signatures and Forgery"},{"id":"revocations-of-digital-signatures","depth":2,"text":"Revocations of Digital Signatures"},{"id":"digital-signatures-and-revocation-lists","depth":3,"text":"Digital Signatures and Revocation Lists"},{"id":"advantages-and-disadvantages-of-digital-signatures","depth":2,"text":"Advantages and disadvantages of Digital Signatures"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Digital Sig","src":"/images/blog/Digital-Sig-300x161.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In cyberspace, where vast amounts of information are flying around at the speed of light and where authors can publish seemingly authoritative content completely anonymously, integrity becomes a strongly sought after commodity.

Knowing what you received is authentic, untampered, and from a trusted party is imperative to making informed decisions. To answer these questions of trust, the internet turned to cryptography to provide solutions. Traditional cryptographic methods of providing such trust have come by the use of digital signatures, digital certificates, and GPG. But what exactly are these tools and how do they work? \n\n \n\nIn this multi-part series, we explore various methods used to ensure integrity in the digital world and the cybersphere.\n\n \n\n## **History of Digital Signatures** \n\nThe use of digital signatures has been around for decades, dating back to 1976. Below is a brief history of digital signatures:\n\n \n\n**1976**: A theory of a digital signature scheme was first described by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. However, Diffie and Hellman never put their scheme into practice.\n\n**1977**: The RSA algorithm was invented by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adlem and could be used to create a sort of primitive digital signature.\n\n**1988**: The RSA algorithm was used in the Lotus Development Corporation’s product, Lotus Notes 1.0. The product became the first widely marketed software package to offer digital signatures. \n\n**1999**: Adobe adds the option to embed digital signatures into their Portable Document Format (PDF) 2000. Additionally, the United States makes digital signatures legally binding under certain conditions in the ESIGN Act of 2000. \n\n**2008**: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopts the PDF file format as an open standard in its ISO 32000 specifications, which includes digital signatures.”\n\n \n\n## **Digital Signatures, the Basics**\n\nPut simply, a digital signature, also sometimes referred to as an electronic signature, is a string of numbers and letters used to validate the identity of a person. Its purpose is to ensure the original content sent is unchanged. Regardless of whether a digital signature is encrypted or sent in the clear (i.e. in plaintext so anyone can read it), they provide the three following features: \n\n \n\n1. **Authentication** \\- Digital signatures are bound to a specific user via their private key. Thus they identify the owner of the private key used to sign the source data/message (e.g. document, email, or file). \n2. **Integrity** - Digital signatures use a hashing algorithm to ensure that a message received is untampered. (More about hashing below.) \n3. **Non-Repudiation** - Due to the two previous features, digital signatures ensure a sender who has signed the source data cannot deny having signed it at a later time.\n\n \n\n### **Hashes and Digital Signatures**\n\nA hash is the output of a hashing algorithm. Each source file, when input into a hashing algorithm produces a unique hash. When a source file is modified in any kind of way, even if only a blank space is added or a single letter is changed, the hash is changed as well. In fact, for every change in the input source file, the output hash, also known as a digest, drastically changes. This characteristic is known as the avalanche effect and is demonstrated by the below graphic. Notice how significantly different each digest is from the previous, with only a minor change in the input.\n\n \n\n![Hash_Function-375px](/images/blog/Hash_Function-375px-300x218.png)\n\n \n\nAn additional characteristic of the hashing family of mathematics is that it is impossible to reconstruct the original source file from a produced hash. It is one of the fundamental properties that make a hashing algorithm ideal for security.\n\n \n\n## **Overview of How Digital Signatures Work** \n\nDigital signatures use two large, asymmetrical mathematically related numbers (actually letters and numbers) known as public and private keys. These keys together form a key pair. In the same way, physical keys are used for locking and unlocking, cryptographic key pairs are used for encrypting (locking) and decrypting (unlocking) source data so it is intelligible. Private keys are stored safely and kept confidential, as if anyone ever knew the private key of another person, they could then sign source data as that other person. In contrast, public keys are meant to be shared with everyone. It is only by using the public key that the data encrypted by the private key can be decrypted so the original data can be known.\n\n \n\nIn short, to digitally sign something, a sender uses their private key. In order for the receiver to authenticate the digital signature, they need to use the sender’ public key. \n\n \n\nLet’s break it down step by step.\n\n \n\n## **The Digital Signing Process**\n\nHere’s how the signing process works.\n\n1. The sender calculates the hash of the source content they want to send using a hashing algorithm.\n2. The sender encrypts the calculated hash with their private key in order to produce a digital signature. \n3. The digital signature is then associated with the content and bundled into a transmission. (In the case of the diagram below, the transmission is the signed message.) \n4. The sender sends the transmission.\n5. The receiver receives the transmission.\n6. The receiver opens the transmission and removes the sender’s digital signature.\n7. The receiver uses the sender’s publicly available public key to decrypt the sender’s encrypted digital signature. (If successful, the identity of the owner of the private key used to encrypt the file (typically the sender) is verified.)(This step is denoted as ‘Sender’s Public Key’ in the diagram.)\n8. Then the receiver removes the original content from the transmission and calculates a new hash for it. \n9. If the receiver’s calculated hash matches the sender’s calculated hash the content is verified to be identical to what the content the sender sent. Otherwise, if the hashes don’t match then the content has been altered and should not be trusted.\n\n \n\nUpon successful decryption and found matching hash, the source data is authenticated as untampered and the owner of the private key is validated as the source data encryptor. \n\n \n\n![Digital-signature diagram](/images/blog/Digital-signature-300x163.png)\n\n \n\nDue to the fact that the sender’s public key is publicly available, it means that anyone has the ability to decrypt the encrypted content the sender sends. Therefore, this type of encryption technique only authenticates integrity, but not confidentiality.\n\n \n\n## **Anatomy of a Signed Document (Source Data)**\n\nHere is the basic structure of a digital signed asset. Source data is combined with its hash to produce a digitally signed asset. Pretty straightforward.\n\n \n\n![Digital Signature Anatomy](/images/blog/Digital-Signature-Anatomy-300x157.png)\n\n \n\n## **Digital Signatures and Forgery** \n\nCan digital signatures be forged? No, they can’t. The mathematics behind them ensures that. However, a private key can be compromised, though that is another matter regarding key storage rather than a compromise of mathematical function uniqueness. Additionally, multiple private keys can belong to the same owner, but that is just a reproduction of intended use.\n\n## **Revocations of Digital Signatures**\n\nSo far, so good. Digital signatures sound perfect for ensuring the integrity and validating identity. But once created, are they valid forever? What if a digital asset is found to be corrupted or needs to be deprecated? Or an employee who sided an asset, is discovered to be untrustworthy or a paid corporate saboteur? Can their digital signatures be invalidated? Unfortunately, the answer is, “No, they can’t”. Once a document is digitally signed, a signature cannot be revoked. All of their past digitally signed assets remain valid. \n\n \n\nThink of the act of digitally signing similar to a producing a signature from a physical pen. Just the same as an ink signature, a digital signature cannot be controlled remotely. Once it’s there, it’s valid forever as long as the digital signature was valid at the time of signing. \n\n \n\nHowever, similar to a wet (ink) signature, a document can be “un-signed” by marking through the signature before, and only before, the document is distributed. Once the signed document has been sent into the wild, removing a signature is difficult to impossible.\n\n \n\nThis happens to be by design. For example, imagine if you had a hard-won customer who committed to purchase services from you. Then you made a sizable and unreturnable investment in the materials you need to complete the services for the new account. And then just after you do so, your customer revokes the contract and you’re stuck with no recourse because the signature was revoked. Just like paper contracts, once a digital contract is accepted, it can’t be revoked, though it can be canceled through mutual agreement. Regardless, if the signature is wet ink or digital 1’s and 0’s, your signature counts.\n\n### **Digital Signatures and Revocation Lists**\n\nThere are no revocation lists for digital signatures. Revocation lists are used to keep track of digital certificates that are no longer trusted. They do not apply to non-digital certificate affiliated digital signatures. \n\n \n\n## **Advantages and disadvantages of Digital Signatures**\n\nAs you can probably ascertain, digital signatures have a lot of benefits including they:\n\n \n\n- Increase security and confidence as they cannot be reverse-engineered or forged.\n- Offer non-repudiation of the source data encryptor.\n- Ensure the integrity of sent source data.\n\n \n\nHowever, digital signatures also have some disadvantages such as:\n\n \n\n- There is no method for revoking signatures (source data trust) after they have been distributed, effectively making decisions permanent.\n- The use of public keys does not allow for confidentiality. Anyone with a public key can decrypt the source data.\n\n \n\nIf you are looking to ensure the security, integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, and have the ability to instantly revoke trust in your source data, try out CodeNotary by clicking below:\n\n \n\n[Start Free Trial](https://dashboard.codenotary.io/auth/signup)\n\n \n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[https://community.aiim.org/blogs/larry-kluger/2013/12/05/digital-signatures-are-forever](https://community.aiim.org/blogs/larry-kluger/2013/12/05/digital-signatures-are-forever)\n\n[https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-kim.pdf](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-kim.pdf)\n\n[https://daman.nic.in/downloads/2015/Guideline-for-digital-signature.pdf](https://daman.nic.in/downloads/2015/Guideline-for-digital-signature.pdf)\n\n[https://www.ukessays.com/essays/communications/history-of-digital-signatures-communications-essay.php](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/communications/history-of-digital-signatures-communications-essay.php)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic\\_hash\\_function\n\n[https://commons.wikipedia.org](https://commons.wikimedia.org)\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/what-are-digital-signatures-and-how-do-they-work","extension":".md","slug":"what-are-digital-signatures-and-how-do-they-work","createdAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-03T10:38:39.742Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601721624992},"$loki":71},{"title":"What Docker Notary Doesn’t Do","image":"/images/blog/Global-Verification-Blockchain-Based-Code-Signing-300x232.png","date":"2019-06-12","toc":[{"id":"what-is-docker-notary","depth":2,"text":"What is Docker Notary"},{"id":"how-docker-notary-works","depth":2,"text":"How Docker Notary Works"},{"id":"docker-notary-hashing","depth":2,"text":"Docker Notary Hashing"},{"id":"criticisms-of-docker","depth":2,"text":"Criticisms of Docker"},{"id":"docker-and-its-shaky-certificate-authority-scaffolding","depth":2,"text":"Docker and its Shaky Certificate Authority Scaffolding"},{"id":"what-is-codenotary","depth":2,"text":"What is CodeNotary"},{"id":"how-codenotary-works","depth":2,"text":"How CodeNotary Works"},{"id":"dockernotary-vs-codenotary","depth":2,"text":"DockerNotary vs CodeNotary"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Global Verification Blockchain Based Code Signing","src":"/images/blog/Global-Verification-Blockchain-Based-Code-Signing-300x232.png"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you pull from say Docker Hub, modify an image and then upload the new image to a different hosting service, say your company’s personal, non-Docker affiliated repo, how will you know if the original image was authentically safe and verifiably untampered?

In the DevOps process, various teams (dev, test, stage, prod) or even subsets of these teams will pull from different hosting services like Docker Hub, code and artifact hosts, and 3rd party libraries. Moving files and /images/blog around from one registry to another can create weak links in the integrity chain. Until recently, there has been no solution that enables global verification of digital assets that is host service agnostic like CodeNotary.\n\n \n\nIn this blog, we will discuss the difference between a traditional notarization service using Docker Notary as an example and compare it to CodeNotary’s capabilities.\n\n \n\n## **What is Docker Notary**\n\nDocker Notary is an open source service tool that allows publishers to digitally sign their collections of files, /images/blog, containers, etc. while enabling users of those assets to verify the provenance and integrity of the content they pull.\n\n \n\nIn order for you to be able to sign an image, which is not a prerequisite for visibility, you must have a Notary server attached to a Docker Registry. As an illustration, Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) and Docker Hub are two examples of a Docker Registry.\n\n \n\n## **How Docker Notary Works**\n\nPrior to a publisher pushing an image to a registry, the image needs to be signed by Docker Engine locally using the publisher’s private key. The signing process generates a hash of the image on the user’s machine and attaches it to the identity that created it.\n\n \n\nLater, when a user pulls the image, the image hash is verified using the publisher’s public key. The verification lets the user know exactly what he is about to run in his environment as well as ensures that the image is the latest version from the repo and has not been tampered with.\n\n \n\nSome popular registries for hosting Docker Container /images/blog include:\n\n \n\n- DockerHub\n- Azure Container Registry\n- Google Container Registry\n- Quay Container Registry\n- Amazon Elastic Container Registry\n- GitLab Container Registry\n\n \n\n## **Docker Notary Hashing**\n\nThe issue here is that if the user’s machine is compromised, then changes could be made and/or malicious code could be injected into an image (container, file, code, etc.) just before the hash is calculated, corrupting the file’s integrity. This would be done without the user even knowing, thus giving the user the illusion of safety.\n\n \n\nFurther exacerbating the issue, the user would then upload the injected image under his account name, thereby testifying to its authenticity, and making it available to spread to more machines.\n\n## **Criticisms of Docker**\n\nWith the recent discovery of the container bug, CVE-2019-5736, that demonstrated how a container infection could escape and attack a host system, it is paramount that containers, /images/blog, and files have their integrity verified. Because containers don’t exist in a vacuum and are not entirely isolated, users need to be 100% sure that the containers they are running are safe in the first place.\n\n \n\nThe detection of CVE-2019-5736 prompted one Docker user to note on SlashDot:\n\n \n\n_Docker is a mess because it was originally developed in a way that served the interests of Docker Inc. \\[e.g.\\] the single local name space of /images/blog, the poor default implement of a remote registry, \\[and\\] the ability to only search /images/blog in dockerhub. It wasn't designed to support secure isolation. That was bolted on later and needs continual patching._\n\n \n\nThe once thought of safe containers that were given access to secrets and user credentials in order to fulfill their functions, now compound the exploitation issue. Containers are so pervasive, that the finding of the 5736 container bug has ushered in a nightmarish-eske scenario where the security gates have been found to be open the whole time even though everyone thought they were closed.\n\n \n\nWhat this means for the Docker community is that container security and integrity are called into question. What is needed is a full audit of all existing containers and their trust boundaries, which is only a slightly sizeable order. After which, secure containers will need to be marked as trusted so the integrity question doesn’t linger and the danger doesn’t continue to manifest.\n\n \n\n## **Docker and its Shaky Certificate Authority Scaffolding**\n\nDocker has an enterprise level image storage solution called Docker Trust Registry (DTR) that can be set up locally by users. In order to set up a local DTR connected registry, you need to first get a digital certificate (DC). Docker lists 3 ways to generate a certificate for a new registry:\n\n \n\n1. The enterprise can utilize its own PKI infrastructure\n2. Buy a certificate from a public certificate authority\n3. Use a DTR generated self signed registry certificate\n\n \n\nIronically, even with all the problems continually surrounding DCs, Docker still uses them as the root of trust for setting up a new DTR linked registry. We have written many times, including [here](https://www.codenotary.io/the-distributed-ledger-technology-at-the-center-of-the-code-signing-disruption/) and [here](https://www.codenotary.io/code-signing-certificates-journey-of-pain-3-when-even-signing-isnt-enough/), about the folly of trusting digital certificates completely.\n\n \n\nDocker further notes in its documentation that if none of the above methods are workable solutions, then you have the option to configure your environment to run in what’s known as “insecure” mode. Docker does suggest to only do this for pre-production builds and to be sure you know who you are connecting to. However, just because something should happen doesn’t mean it will happen, and oftentimes doesn’t happen.\n\n \n\nIn fact, we found a justification on GitLab Docs that suggested using an insecure Registry in order to speed up the communication traffic between Docker clients and servers. With the furiously busy schedules of devs today, security is often left on the sidelines so production can push on. It happens. And you can bet money it will happen again. If only all devs produced clean, bug free, functional code, the world would be a better place. That said, many devs do, but those that don’t - no one wants to be that guy.\n\n \n\n## **What is CodeNotary**\n\nCodeNotary is an application for verifying continuous trust throughout the entire DevOps process. It allows for global integrity verification of digital assets including code, /images/blog, containers, backups, etc. and goes beyond the limitations of digital certificates. CodeNotary's software also enables visibility into asset related metrics such as the number of times an image is verified and number of assets signed by your and your team. It also allows for instant asset revocation in case an image is should no longer be trusted due to deprecation or compromise.\n\n## **How CodeNotary Works**\n\nUsing CodeNotary is simple with 1 step to sign and 1 step to verify.\n\n \n\nYou can sign your source code, libraries, builds, and containers using the command syntax `vcn sign` in your CLI. The command immutably stores your signatures on the blockchain.\n\n \n\nUse the command `vcn verify` in order to verify the integrity of the digital assets you use. This also enables anyone to verify the authenticity of your /images/blog, containers, and code against the distributed ledger where their hashes are stored.\n\n \n\n## **DockerNotary vs CodeNotary**\n\nIn contrast to Docker Notary, CodeNotary calculates the hash of a file non-locally on the blockchain. This offers 2 distinct advantages:\n\n \n\n1. The hash calculation cannot be attacked unless the entire network succumbs to a 51% attack (an extremely difficult feat to pull off due to the very high, fault tolerant data replication of the decentralized system)\n2. The identity of the signer is immutably and non-locally stored on the blockchain right along with the container’s hash.\n\n \n\nCodeNotary’s use of the blockchain also offers another very unique property. It allows for teams in the various stages of DevOps to pull unrestrictedly from different hosting services such as Docker Hub, code and artifact hosting, and 3rd party libraries, amongst others. Its global integrity verification of digital assets is host service agnostic. Regardless if an image is pulled from a non-Docker affiliated hosting service, the trust status of an asset will always be verifiable against the blockchain. In contrast, Docker Notary is limited to only verifying /images/blog that utilize the DTR network and are simultaneously underpinned by the flawed practice of using digital certificates.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, CodeNotary has the benefit of being able to verify the integrity of any digital asset in the DevOps process and not being limited to only Dockerfiles, /images/blog, or containers. As such, it enables more overview of your DevOps environment.\n\n \n\nIf you like, click below and you can try out for yourself CodeNotary’s Verification tool.

That makes it very convenient to sign or verify files while browsing within the Windows File Explorer.\n\n![CodeNotary vcn within explorer](/images/blog/windows_explorer.png)\n\n## How to start?\n\n### We made it as simple as it can get. It's a few quick steps and completely free.\n\nThe best is to sign up on our landing page for non-commercial projects and then register on our CodeNotary dashboard. Please make sure to use the email address and send the project URL to your non-commercial offering.\n\nWe activate your license as fast as possible (usually within a day) and then you're good to go.\n\nAnd please don't forget to leave feedback as we love to get your opinion on our products.

Having software developed by multiple suppliers around the world, though, exposes companies to a number of supply chain risks. These risks can and must be hedged against.\n\n \n\nSoftware supply chain attacks are not new to the industry, but when the malware injected in the Avast supply chain infected 2.3 million customers, the problem started to get proper attention. While much has been said of the problem since the CCleaner attack, the ASUS security breach proves that not enough has been done to prevent the issue from happening again.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, companies like ASUS with their sprawling supply chains and their “trusted” networks of software producing coders from around the world, only increases the number of attack vectors hackers have to exploit. This is just one more giant reason companies need to secure their supply chains with more diligence and resolve.\n\n \n\nLet’s take a look at how the ASUS attack was carried out. Hackers injected the ASUS update code with malware and signed it with one of ASUS's own digital certificates. Because the certificate was valid, the injected code was then pushed to ASUS's software distribution servers. As a result, more than a million ASUS customers unwittingly downloaded and installed the malicious update on their computers.\n\n \n\nIn this case, the backdoor sat on ASUS update servers for months before the company was able to identify the issue. And yet even after the exploit was recognized, the signing certificate used in the attack was not revoked, leaving customers to continuously suffer the effects of being comprised by the injected malware.\n\n## Lessons learned from the ASUS attack\n\n \n\nAfter two attacks of such magnitude and the repeated methodology used by hackers, it’s time to humbly recognize the lessons learned from software supply chain attacks, and to take necessary corrective actions:\n\n \n\n1. Software supply chain attacks represent an effective and inexpensive way hackers can infect millions of computers with malware\n2. Trusting a coder doesn’t mean that you can trust his security practices, especially when he’s working remotely where your company’s security policies cannot be enforced\n3. Code signing and digital certificates, the de-facto _claimed_ solution for software integrity verification, have repeatedly proven to be unable to guarantee software trust\n4. The certificate revocation process is almost never enforced, leaving users to continuous exposure to malicious software even after issues are identified\n\n \n\nIn order to solve these problems, software development processes must take a page out of the industrial manufacturing’s playbook. Manufacturing companies, in fact, vet and monitor each supplier and material before and after they become part of the supply chain. Here’s a simple checklist that companies should keep in mind when implementing a distributed software supply chain:\n\n \n\n1. Be capable of inhibiting coders from accessing their supply chain process when they cannot trust a coder anymore\n2. Enforce integrity verification at every step of the development workflow\n3. Verify trust from development to production and create a Trusted Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)\n4. Instantly recall any software produced by a non-trusted party\n5. Notify users of the issue so that they can install the correct patch\n\n## How CodeNotary can prevent software supply chain attacks\n\nCodeNotary provides the capabilities needed to bring trust to the software supply chain. With CodeNotary, developers sign their code with their unique identity, so that it can be verified for integrity and origin. This can happen at every stage of the software lifecycle from development to production to distribution. \n\n \n\nHere is how CodeNotary brings trust to the software supply chain:\n\n \n\n1. Developers sign, with a single command, the hashes of code they produce using their unique identity. Having a one command process makes signing extremely easy and eliminates any overhead\n2. The signed code is verified for integrity and authenticity as it moves along the supply chain, from IDE to source control, to build, to deployment and finally production and distribution. CodeNotary makes code integrity verification part of the build and deployment for a fully automated and secure process\n3. Only the code that passes the integrity verification is allowed to move into the next stage. This continuous integrity creates a trusted supply chain pipeline that software vendors can rely on\n4. In case of a rogue coder, CodeNotary can immediately revoke his signature and untrust his code \n5. The final product contains only trusted code, tracked in the product SBOM\n6.

This was due to an supply chain attack on the video game developer application Microsoft Visual Studio. Electronic Extreme was one of 3 companies targeted in what is being described by security researchers as a landmark event in the cyberattack community. The notability of the MS Visual Studio hack event is less in the hundreds of thousands of likely infected victims and more in the way the hack was carried out to target upstream software developer tools.\n\n \n\n## **Overview of What Happened**\n\nBoth Kaspersky and ESET discovered clues that connect the Microsoft Visual Studio event to the ASUS attack, which we wrote about previously [here](https://www.codenotary.io/what-the-asus-software-updates-hijack-teach-us-about-software-supply-chain-risks/)**.** However, the execution tactics are escalating into a huge area of vulnerability for the software industry. Namely these attacks are targeting more and more upstream in the software supply chain and are taking aim at the developer tools themselves.\n\n \n\nThe compromised Microsoft development tools were digitally signed and valid. As such, they led to the sealed approval and digital signing of the games the affected companies produced. The distributed games compromised 92,000 systems though the number is likely far higher and potentially in the amount of hundreds of thousands.\n\n \n\n## **How It the Attack Happened**\n\nDespite the large ramifications the attack had, investigations into the hack uncovered a tiny, malicious “linker”. The injected linker caused the MS Visual Studio platform used by the game developers to be redirected to pull from a malicious library instead of the company intended, benign, preset one.\n\n \n\nThe level of sophistication was taken up a notch, as researchers into the event observed the attackers were employing a series of attack waves in their strategy. The attack played out in multiple stages of 1) developing intelligence through reconnaissance using a trojan before 2) injecting the malware. The information the attackers learned during their ‘recon’ phase allowed them to be much more sniper like with their targeting implementation during phase 2.\n\n \n\n## **The Role of Compromised Digital Signatures**\n\nSomehow (it is still unknown) the attackers were able to attain and use two valid digital certificates in order to keep their malware flying under the radar. Digital certificates are one level of security but due to their limitations, which we have written about several times including [here](https://www.codenotary.io/the-distributed-ledger-technology-at-the-center-of-the-code-signing-disruption/) and [here](https://www.codenotary.io/code-signing-certificates-journey-of-pain-3-when-even-signing-isnt-enough/), are not enough to ensure integrity throughout the entire software lifecycle.\n\n \n\nDigital certificates only address the final product and not the incremental steps and components that compile along the way to create the final product. In short, due to their drawbacks, digital certificates are not designed to be used to achieve fine tuned granularity that can ensure integrity at the component level and on down.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, due to the previously mentioned fact, digital certificates become a huge centralized point of failure and a glaring liability, especially if they have been used to sign large amounts of shipped software. In such cases, revocation for publishers, which you can read more about in our blog [here](https://www.codenotary.io/the-failure-of-the-certificate-revocation-list-crl/), becomes a nightmare to think about.\n\n \n\nIn the case of the MS Visual Studio hack, the two compromised digital certificates used by the attackers have been used previously to sign over 3000 legitimate ASUS files. Thus, it is no surprise that a month after the compromised certificates were reported to ASUS, the certificates are still being used. Not only that, but the same compromised certificates are being used to sign newly produced software. The practice is completely nonsensical.\n\n \n\n## **Future Implications for Software Industry**\n\nThe aftershocks of the attack are reverberating throughout the digital security world with implications for the future of the software community. The attack itself has provided glimpses of what’s to come. Attackers are becoming more targeted and systematic in their approaches and zero’ing in the weak points of the industry. The looming blind spot of lax security in the software supply chain is bound to invite more attacks. As Vitaly Kamluk, Kaspersky's director of Asia-focused research, was quoted as saying, “...it’s just the tip of the iceberg.”\n\n \n\n## **Security Recommendations from the Experts**\n\nThe attack is a critical wake up call. Especially now that attackers are honing in on exploiting the weaknesses in the upstream software development supply chain, producers need to be even more vigilant. They should be asking themselves questions like:\n\n \n\n- What is the origin of my software development tools?\n- Are my tools verifiably official and un-tampered?\n- When’s the last time our compiler integrity was checked?\n\n \n\nSecurity research expert, Kamluk, noted that probably no one is asking and/or answering these questions, which is why the problem is and will continue to escalate into including larger and larger numbers of victims.\n\n \n\n## **How to Protect Yourself and Your Company**\n\nWith the weak links of digital certificates, you might wonder if they should stop being used or being relied upon completely. With the amount of infrastructure that currently relies on digital certificates, pulling the rug out from under the industry is not advisable. Digital certificates have their place in the security world and do still serve a purpose, though limited in scope they might be.\n\n \n\nIt’s simply that with the current holes in their application and the inherent short-comings they house, the software universe needs an additional security layer to compliment digital certificates and fill the gaps they leave. **As Kaspersky noted, “Software vendors should introduce another line in their software building conveyor that additionally checks their software for potential malware injections even after the code is digitally signed.”**\n\n \n\nFortunately, the technology now exists that makes it not only possible but also financially feasible to verify the integrity of all the elements in produced, ready to ship software. (Can you imagine how much it would cost to buy a $250 digital certificate for every component and snippet included in a final build? Hence, why nobody does it.)\n\n \n\n## **CodeNotary for Verifiable Integrity at the Atomic Level**\n\nWith CodeNotary’s blockchain based simple 1-step integrity verification process, devs and admins alike can be sure they are only including 100% verified, untampered code into their pipeline. Code integrity no longer has to be a guessing game that includes a hope and pray strategy chaser. At every stage of the build process now, integrity can be verified quickly, easily, and automatically.\n\n \n\nCodeNotary’s potent, multi-layered, security solution integrates seamlessly into devops processes today. It prevents problems from arising and scaling in size later on down the pipeline (/nod to the MS Visual Studio attack) creating significant savings in terms of potential patch costs, injured reputations, customer attrition, and other associated damages.\n\n \n\nIf you like, you can take CodeNotary for a test spin and see for yourself.

In this turn of the page in the ongoing war between white hats and black hats, it is clear a new dawn is steadily emerging where even established software producers are vulnerable to having their good names dragged through the mud.
