We are so excited about the high demand for our Chat OpBot!

This gives us another confirmation that this tool is extremely helpful for daily use and has a lot of potential for our customers. This is the first tool that we have in use daily and we discover new useful applications every day.

Here are some postings from our blogging friends. We want to say a big "Thank you guys!" for your help.

[Luc Dekens](https://twitter.com/LucD22) is a long-time friend of Opvizor and an expert in many areas.

I'm pleased to share his feedback about our OpBot:

> I do love integration, and especially when it is done in a new, innovative way.My friend Dennis Zimmer, from Opvizor, recently gave me access to a preview of one of their new tools, which they called ChatOps Bot for VMware vSphere. It combines  vSphere API calls with Slack API calls. Needless to say I liked the concept. And I can see many interesting possibilities.

Thanks Luc for your feedback! Please read the complete Blog post from Luc [here](http://www.lucd.info/?s=opbot).

[Paolo Valsecchi](https://twitter.com/NoLabNoPartY) is the author of the blog [Nolabnoparty.com](http://nolabnoparty.com/en). The blog is mainly focused on virtualization technologies but also covers Active Directory and Networking. He started writing this blog because I needed a point reachable world wide to be used as knowledge base and to store my notes concerning solutions, procedures and fixes.

Here is a part of Paolo's Blog regarding OpBot:

"OpBot is a new free tool released by Opvizor to access different vSphere environments from anywhere in the world that doesn’t require VPN to connect.

Since it doesn’t need VPN, RDP session or mobile hotspot, you can **save a lot of time** while connecting to the systems because you don’t need to wait for vSphere Web client responses.

With OpBot you can get quickly info related to the vSphere environment:

- Get VM and Host Configuration
- Get latest VM, Host performance
- Get latest VM, Host memory, disk usage

This tool can be used to **read informations** of your vSphere environment and can be also connected with [Performance Analyzer](http://nolabnoparty.com/opvizor-performance-analyzer-3-0-per-vsphere/) to obtain new remote **troubleshooting and analysis** possibilities."

Thank you Paolo for your feedback! Please read the complete Blog from Paolo [here](http://nolabnoparty.com/en/opbot-virtual-assistant-vmware-vsphere/).

[Chris Nakagaki](https://twitter.com/Zsoldier) is the author of the Blog [tech.zsoldier.com](http://tech.zsoldier.com/).Here is his Blog post about our OpBot. You can find the complete post [here](http://tech.zsoldier.com/2017/01/powerclipowershell-vcenter-slack-bot.html):

"An OVF from [Opvizor](http://try.opvizor.com/opbot/) that gets deployed to any VMware environment for powercli slack integration.  Very simple deployment model.  

**Current Model:**

1. Appliance can currently only target one vCenter and one slack bot.
2. Permissions are granted via account designated in OVF config. 

- (read only recommended for obvious reasons)
- all commands requested via slack bot run in context of this account.

4. Multiple appliances/vCenters can target one slack bot. 

- _(Ref.1 of two appliances/vcenter targeting one slack bot)_

6. Appliances can also be assigned to individually different slack bots. 

- _(Ref.2 of two different slack bots)_

8. Both models can be achieved by simply doubling up OVF deployments.  One that targets a singular bot, while the other targets a default/catch-all bot.
9. Utilizes [powerclicore](https://labs.vmware.com/flings/powercli-core?src=vmw_so_vex_cnaka_471) so, there are limitations to what powercli cmdlets can be utilized and same limits that [powershellcore](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)may have too."
