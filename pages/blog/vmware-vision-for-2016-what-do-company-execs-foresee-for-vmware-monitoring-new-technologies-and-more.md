Last year, VMware adopted the motto, "One Cloud, Any Application, Any Device." It really sounds just like a savvy slogan that some marketing person probably got way more money for than it was actually worth. Yet, while this motto is not yet a reality, VMware has taken marked steps toward making this slogan come true. Like most companies (especially where the cloud is concerned), the announcement is often made before the technology is in place. So, what is the VMware vision for this year, and how will it move them closer to the reality of, "[One Cloud, Any Application, Any Device](http://blogs.air-watch.com/2016/01/vmware-news-product-event/#.Vtx_H_krJmM)"? 

##  **The Future of the Hybrid Cloud**

_The hybrid cloud makes sense from several perspectives: it's an affordable, secure, convenient solution that can't be matched by either a private cloud or by public cloud services._

The path to the inevitable [selection of the hybrid cloud](http://www.vmware.com/digitalenterprise?src=sc_569fec388f2c9&cid=70134000000Nz2D) by businesses reads a lot like the fairy tale Goldilocks. "The public cloud is too insecure, the private cloud is too expensive, but the hybrid cloud is just right!" The future of the hybrid cloud, according to VMware, is a mixture of the private, public, and managed cloud, and includes both on- and off-premises storage and applications. 

## **The Future of Business Applications** 

Speaking of applications, those will be the "make it or break it" factor for the hybrid cloud. Businesses will continue to leverage all the apps they traditionally have, only the apps will need to be able to access data from (as well as transfer data to) both on- and off-premises cloud environments seamlessly. Apps will also need to be able to work with any device and to play nicely with end user solutions. Inevitably, the success of the hybrid cloud will lie squarely on developers' ability to produce apps that can leverage the cloud as well as provide end users with the accessibility and usability they demand across devices. 

## **The Future of Networking & Security**

_The end user doesn't care how the applications are connected, nor how the data center is kept secure. Their primary concern is fast, convenient access at any time, from any device._

That brings us to the infrastructure that will allow users to leverage the hybrid cloud via those traditional applications. The [concept of the software-defined data center](http://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/vmware-builds-its-software-defined-data-center-vision/1828749345) is another one that is not yet a complete reality, but VMware (as well as other partners and vendors) are making significant strides in the right direction. The end goal will be connecting data centers directly to various devices, while offering the enterprise-grade security that both users and businesses demand.Will all of the issues that have plagued businesses over the past few years go away in 2016? Certainly not. But by the end of the year, expect IT security experts to have better strategies in place to thwart the headline-making kinds of data breaches that have dominated the news over the past couple of years (think Sony, Home Depot, and the US government).Are you ready for the happenings of 2016? 

Perhaps you should begin the year with a better VMware monitoring solution. [Check out our Health Analyzer!](http://try.opvizor.com/health-analyzer/)
