The Services are provided at the router of vChain's data center. Any costs for the telecommunication connection are borne by you and are not included in the subscription fee. vChain is therefore not responsible if the Services are unavailable due to connection failures or interruptions.

### **8\. Data Sharing**

Depending on the type of subscription, the Services may include the possibility to share stored data with other users. In that case, you are given the option to share certain data with other users.

You are solely responsible for keeping the online settings of your account up to date.

### **9\. Re-Use of Data by vChain**

You expressly agree that vChain may include your uploaded data in its internal statistics and analysis databases and to freely use such data, including for the provision of services to other customers of vChain.

Services for Paid Subscriptions will only be provided after payment of such subscription fees according to the chosen payment plan, including the selected billing cycle. The initial subscription fee shall be due immediately after signing up for the respective subscription and any recurring subscription fees shall be due at the last day of the preceding billing cycle. In case of multi-year subscriptions, the subscription fee for the first year of the subscription shall be due immediately after signing up for the respective subscription and the fees for the remaining subscription years shall be due on an annual basis to the end of the respective subscription year.

Subscribing to a Free Subscription does not grant you the right to use the associated Services indefinitely.

If you are paying by credit card, you agree that vChain may i) store your credit card data and ii) automatically issue payment of subscription fees at the respective due date by using such stored credit card data.
