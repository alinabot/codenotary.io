[Veeam® Software](https://www.veeam.com/), the Availability for the Always-On Enterprise™ innovator, announced that [NetApp](http://www.netapp.com/us/index.aspx) will be adding Veeam Availability Solutions to the NetApp global price list. NetApp customers can purchase complete Veeam and NetApp solutions directly from NetApp and its resellers in a single transaction, enabling enterprises to leverage both 24.7.365 availability and IT simplicity.

The combination of [Veeam’s](http://www.veeam.com) Availability solutions with [NetApp](http://www.netapp.com) E-series, AltaVault, ONTAP, All-Flash FAS, and hybrid cloud solution offerings, help organizations simplify IT operational management, lower costs, and attain recovery point and recovery time objectives (RTPO™) of seconds – not hours and days, per legacy solutions – for all applications and data. This agreement will equip 4,000 NetApp resellers globally to deliver NetApp/Veeam integrated Availability solutions.

That's great news for customers as it simplifies their procurement process. But what about the operations team - any simplification for them? Yes, Performance Analyzer now supports [VMware](http://www.vmware.com) vSphere, NetApp ONTAP, Veeam and integrations into your guest OS (Linux or [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com)).

The advantages for the procurement team:

- __NetApp customers can now purchase complete NetApp and Veeam solutions directly from NetApp and its resellers, enabling them to benefit from Veeam’s industry-leading Availability solutions__
- __Simplifies the purchase and delivery process for partners to provide highly differentiated solutions to joint customers__
- __Veeam Availability Suite and Veeam Backup & Replication will be available with NetApp E-series, AltaVault, ONTAP, All-Flash FAS, and hybrid cloud solution offerings__
- __Veeam continues to deliver innovation via direct integration with ONTAP environments to provide enterprise class scalability, performance, agility and ease of management__

The advantages using a combined monitoring product:

- one product combines all metrics and statistics at the same time for the whole environment
- an easy way to find and solve performance issues, like IO load during backup times, database queries in the guest aso.
- reports based on dashboards to get point in time information by email
- merge information in one dashboard for the support teams or create rotating dashboards for the big screen

That means faster response times, less downtime, faster bottleneck and anomaly detection - best operations possible!

Let's get into some dashboards.

VMware vSphere - virtual machine highlights: your #1 dashboard to get an instant idea how your environment is doing

NetApp Volumes View: check the load and utilization of your volumes

Veeam B&R: Get all backup details at the same time you watch your VMs and Filer utilization

Microsoft Windows: Check the guest OS utilization while the backup is running

There is just no simpler way of combining the most important information that makes you decide to trigger actions. Forget about complex monitoring tools, forget about complex operations management. If you need to read through hundreds of pages of a manual to configure a view for your VM vCPU co-stopping metrics or mix backup details with ESXi host or virtual machine load ... a software needs to do a better job supporting any system administrator.
